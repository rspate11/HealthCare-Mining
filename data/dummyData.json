On nights I go to the gym my blood sugar sometimes crashes. I wake up and eat but then the next day Iam left with a hangover feeling, cloudy brain and almost toxic. As if I was out drinking all night and got no sleep. As a working individual I do not have the option of calling in sick and staying in bedI have not once seen an article talking about the after effects of low blood sugar and how to treat that.
