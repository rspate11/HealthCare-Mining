I have tried to make it as readable as possible. My father who is 70 years old has been experiencing continuous hiccups for a year now. This is obviously very painful as he is unable to eat or even sleep properly.After testing countless home remedies, we got him checked by medical experts about 6 months ago. Almost all of them informed us it is due to prolonged stress, which might be true due to certain events in our lives.********** BACKGROUND INFO **********Age = 70 years.Ethnicity = South Asian.He has had high blood pressure and high cholesterol for more than 25 years, has been gout patient too for that amount of time.He has been obese as well for 25+ years, current weight = 245 lb, height = almost 6 feet.He also had type 2 diabetes probably for 15+ years.He can barely walk and is not active at all, mostly due to back and joint pains.He has avoided almost all meat products for 10+ years, but I think he gained weight due to more consumption of carbohydrates, specifically white flour and rice.No smoking/drinking or recreational drugs habits thankfully.He has also been experiencing cough and weakness and loss of appetite for the last 20 days or so.None of the doctors were 100% sure about the solution and prescribed the following tests and medications: ********** TESTS DONE **********All information is within 3 months range.-Uric Acid = 7 [normal]-All Cholesterols Total/HDL/LDL within range-Triglycerides 10-20% above normal range-ALT normal-Blood sugar controlled by 2 medicines, Glucophage and Glucobay-His ultrasound was i think normal too.-In a very recent test, it was shown his heart walls have become thick due to prolonged stress and cholesterol. ********** DOCTORS CURRENT CONSENSUS **********Out of the 5 doctors consulted, 2 are Cardiologists, 2 General Practitioner and a very recent one is Neurologist. Should I also consult Gastroenterologist?-Doctors ruled out existence of tumors or cancers etc based on ultrasound and long history of hiccups.Few doctors also suggested it might be GERD or acid reflux but he does not have all the symptoms.********** ANY OTHER TESTS NEEDED? **********I wonder now why no doctor asked to check his \"cortisol\" range? Is it not important to test to measure stress?Any other important factors to test for his stress levels?Is ENDOSCOPY really needed? No doctor so far suggested it but after researching online it seems very important?**********RECENT MEDICATIONS FOR HICCUPS**********Medications for hiccups he has been using regularly since the past 3-4 months-Motilium tablet [4 months][1+1+1 before each meal]-Nexum capsule [3 months][1+0+1 before each meal]-Gaviscon syrup [3 months] [1+0+1, 1 tbsp after each meal] -Motival tablet [1 month][1, in the night] for stress/anxiety-RIVOTRIL for stress management prescribed by a neurologist for 3 weeks.******OTHER DAILY LONGTERM MEDICATIONS HE TAKES REGULARLY*******These are additional medications he has to take daily for heart, blood pressure, sugar, uric acid and pain killers etc.-COEZIDAY 100mg 1x -CAPOTIN 50mg 2x [0.25+0.25mg]-GLUCOPHANGE 500mg 1x-GLUCOBAY 50mg 1x-DISPIRIN 300mg 1x-ZYLORIC 100mg [URIC ACID]**********THE ONLY TEMPORARY REMEDY THAT WORKS**********A very temporary cure [30 minutes to 1 hour] is drinking any cola [higher the carbonation, better] while standing and bending low.Drinking warm water helps a little bit as well.Please tell me what can we do about it? This has been very painful not only to the patient but for all family members as well.I can of course provide more info if needed. Any help will be highly appreciated.Thank you very much again.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

I have reactive hyoglycemia, so I can't eat rice, pasta, or other meals high in carbs, otherwise I crash soon after. I need to eat about every 2-3 hours, and need some balance there as well (a quality protein bar is a decent snack, but even with that I crash -- real food, with meat, is the only thing that truly holds me). At home, I always keep 2 snacks with me, and if I'm walking around a lot, like at the mall or a hike, I take something like Vitamin Water with me, which, while I typically avoid sugary drinks, it seems to help to sip it.Coming up soon I'm traveling to Asia for two weeks, including an area of China that's outside any major city. I'm wondering if anyone has tips for this. I'm told to expect limited restaurant choices in these areas (I'm also traveling with a group tour, so I can't choose my own stops), and that sometimes restaurants only have rice/pasta dishes (with a small bit of meat on top). I can eat about 1/4 cup of white rice before it's too much... I'm also told that stores there do not sell protein bars, beef jerky, or anything like Vitamin Water. (I'm told they have dried squid, etc, but not jerky as I know it, and other types of bars, but not decent/any protein bars).I'm really not sure what I'm going to do, and am pretty much expecting to get sugar sick a couple times...Also, anyone know of a powdered drink mix that you can pour into water that has a bit of sugar and other nutrients?

The problems also artificially created by medications registered forType 1 or Type 2 where objectively some Type 1 medication hasalso advantages for Type 2 and some Type 2 medications havealso advantages for Type 1. It needs to speak with the doctors about to improve the therapies. There is now some attempt to create 5 therapy groups as seen here: (18)30051-2/fulltext?elsca1=tlpr   For example all Type 1 or Type 2 or LADA, etc. some more, should have Basal-Insulin if useful with Metformin in different doses to adjust to the lowest fasting Glucose of 80-90mg/dl. Type 1 and LADA Basal-Insulin with SR Metformin 500mg every 12 hours.Type 2 possibly Basal-Insulin with SR Metformin 1000mg every 12 hours. (Injecting Insulin can be pain free if well done as I do it daily. Additionallyat Type 1 the Rapid-Insulin to meals and at Type 2 this possibly not.As Basal-Insulin I\u2019m prefer the Toujeo because that can daily beenadjusted to observe at following 3-4 days, where for example the Tresiba need 4 days to be adjusted for afterwards to observe atfollowing 3-4 days. The Tresiba creates a perfect straight line, wherethe Toujeo still has a very flat curve with a Tmax but this I like andfor that reason I\u2019m injecting it in the morning to have at evening alittle more effect where I have at evening a little higher mg/dl, forpeople in the morning with a little higher to inject at evening.) Metformin is also reducing heart failure risks. At my son with Type 1and myself I could see the Metformin advantages combined with theBasal-Insulin, because the Liver-Glucose is much better under controland this provides a much easier Glucose managing. There has beenonly one problem, because we both underweight cloud not lose moreweight and daily every 12 hours 500mg SR Metformin is monthly reducing about 1-2 lbs and therefore we did need to stop that. About the Heart and Blood Pressure it needs Potassium supplementing.There is a worldwide Potassium deficiency in the populations and theHeart cannot really function without the right amount of Potassium. This especially by people using some reduced diets or low-carb diet. From my own experience I can tell, by not having any micro-macro-vascular problems resulting neuropathic symptoms and not using diets,just normal homemade food, after over 50 years of SIS 110-120 and Potassium more at normal-minimum, to my surprise got SIS 150-160by myself a little underweight and the feet\u2019s started to get swollen. Since about 3 months now I\u2019m supplementing the Potassium by daily1 Slow-K Tablet every 12 hours and I got back my SIS 110-120 andswollen feet\u2019s disappeared and the Basal-Insulin from daily 18-20 UnitsI could reduce to only 6 Units with the same fasting Glucose 80-90mg/dland the Rapid-Insulin at meals could also reduce to less than half. At Potassium is mentioned, also to regulate the Glucose Metabolism! I can imagine that Potassium at Type 2 can also do a good job. If there are diabetes related other disorders, it naturally needadditional medical considerations or medications. I provided this as from my own experiences and possibly by this canalso give to others some ideas or help.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

They refuse to look for simple ways to make improvements in their health. They think, \"I'll just let my doctor tell me what to do.\" There's two problems with this line of thinking:1. They don't follow anyone's advice, let alone, their doctor's, and2. Their doctor only see's them for 15 minutes every 6-12 months (What about the other 262, 775 minutes?).It's the cumulative healing power of the \"little things\" one performs during the course of each day that's the real \"doctor\" in the fight against T2D (and every other lifestyle disease). Here's a few examples of some small lifestyle practices that can make a big impact on this disease...1. Upon waking in the AM, drink as much water as you possibly can. I drink 3/4 of a liter, workout for one hour, drink 1/4 of liter of water, then, drink a cup of coffee, no sugar. If properly hydrated, you should pee all of this out in about 90-120 minutes. If not, you ain't \"properly hydrated\" (dehydration is at the core of most health issues, today).2. I thoroughly rinse my mouth out with warm water after eating. This limits bacterial growth in the mouth that destroys the enamel on teeth and can contribute to inflammation in the gut.3. Emotional wellness is good for the body. Maintaining a positive attitude and performing \"good deed(s)\" throughout the day places your mind (and body) in a good place. 4. Scrub your skin when showering to exfoliate and open up skin pores. This encourages new skin growth, fights aging wrinkled skin. Remember: Think \"little things\".<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

So when I was at the store I brought a device with the test strips. I probably did over 20 different samples. I ate a lot of crackers and pretzels around 130-2pm. I started testing around 5 and finished around 530 just to get a string of numbers and to get the hang of it. I\u2019ve never been diagnosed with diabetes or have symptoms but here are my values. 137 130 203 215 100 110 90 112 129 142 118 145 118 129 145 118 46 142 Those are some of the values I started recording. I know the numbers vary a lot. I\u2019ve been trying to get the right amount on the test strip. Sometimes I would flood it, some times I would almost fill the entire little box up, fill it, and not fill the strip all the way. Later on 3 hours after I ate my dinner I tested my sugar again. I got a reading of 97,112,120, and before I went to bed it got a reading of 116.The next morning I woke up and got a reading after not eating for 12 hours a score of 107. Which is above the recommended fasting range of 80-100. So I tested a few more times ten minutes later and scored 112,108,86,99,94, and 92. A few hours later I ate a frozen dinner for breakfast and had my coffee and two hours after eating I tested again and got another series of numbers. I got many numbers in the low 100s, some in the 110-120 range and two in the 130s. I guess that\u2019s in normal range. I also was looking at my blood test results from my doctor from the past years. Here\u2019s what they had.February 2016 fasting glucose 94 (they put it in as fasting but I know I wasn\u2019t at the time)October 2016 random glucose 79January 2018 random glucose 86.They were all in normal range but the thing I\u2019m worried about were the higher values I got at home when I first did it and the 107 when I first got up. Should I worry about being diabetic or am I putting too much thought into it. I\u2019m so worried about my health and I can\u2019t help it because I have OCD so I keep on obsessing.

The old Metformin by possible max. dose of daily up-to 2500mg. 2. 24 hours Basal-Insulin as Toujeo or Tresiba. Here the Insulin which generally is Hypogenic as Anti-Hypogenic declared, because it can been fine adjusted in such a manner that Hypos by the Basal-Insulin are impossible. Attention, for example Levemir is not a Basal-Insulin as seen at its diagram where it has a huge mountain with hugeefficiency falling afterwards. Real Basal-Insulin as the two abovehave in the diagram a nearly flat horizontal line and because ofthat they can been adjusted for not causing any Hypos and by this set at lowest Fasting Glucose of 80 \u2013 90 mg/dl to be OK.

This started to happen all at the same time. My lower back gets \"tweaked\" fairly easily also. I cannot walk very far without my legs getting exhausted and hurting. The right foot being the more numb always and the right leg having the most pain and weakness. The swelling in my feet and ankles is the same for both and it is sometimes worse, sometimes better, on a daily basis even though it is minor yet consistent. Had an MRI done at VA hospital. Have \"mild to moderate\" spinal stenosis. Had lungs x-rayed and kidney function tests (by my request, not the VA primary care doctor's) to rule out those possibly being a problem leading to the swelling. Primary care doctor at VA had a blood test to see if I possibly had excess water retention in my blood. Sees no reason whatsoever to do a heart echocardiogram or anything of that sort to test my heart to see if that may be a possible cause of the consistent swelling in my feet and ankles even though I inquired to ask that it be done.By my request, I had a referral to a neurologist. Had both an arterial and nerve conduction tests done being requested by the neurologist (neuro surgeon). Arterial test normal. Nerve conduction test revealed \"more than moderate\" L5 nerve neuropathy on my right hip and thigh. Neuro surgeon did not elaborate cause of feet and ankle swelling except to tell me that it was \"just a little\" and only that my peripherial nerves coming from my spine where the stenosis is were the cause of my feet numbness. I was told by primary care doctor at VA that my lymph system \"is\" compromised (lymphedema) due to nerve issues in my lower spine, however, there is nothing listed anywhere I have looked saying that could ever be caused by nerves, nor anything anywhere else that I look up can give me a conclusive answer as to whether nerve issues can or cannot cause any type of swelling anywhere at all whatsoever....even though I have seen numerous people on health forums describing swelling issues with feet an ankles along with having spinal nerve issues (herniated discs, spinal stenosis, etc.).<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

I'm a 16 year old female and the last couple of days I haven't been feeling the best. However, I noticed that right before I started to feel this way I became particularly afraid of developing diabetes. It started off with slight numbness in my feet. At first I assumed it was only a placebo effect causing the sudden numbness. And then the numbness disappeared and it turned into a weird feeling in my calf, not a pins and needles sensation but just a strange feeling. Shortly after, I noticed that I started to feel generally unwell, like I had a bad cold. I noticed that I would get chills at random times. However, right before all of these symptoms started I just felt generally less hungry and I wasn't eating much, maybe about one meal a day. At first I assumed that perhaps it was caused by me not eating much.Then I noticed that I felt an increased need to urinate. I found that I felt the increased need the most when I was worrying about diabetes. However whenever I urinated only a little would come out and it usually had a strong scent of ammonia. Also I'll occasionally get these weird on and off feelings of being very drowsy. I noticed they usually occurred around 9 pm until usually midnight. I found it strange that eating usually made the fatigue go away temporarily. I would assume that eating would usually make it worst so this adds onto my doubts. The weird leg sensation has also been on and off as well and it usually goes away temporarily while I'm being physically active. If I now think about it, this illness has been kinda on and off. One minute I'll feel almost completely healthy then next minute I feel as if I didn't sleep at all the previous night. Also, I checked my weight and I haven't gain nor lost any at all. Also I've been feeling feverish so I assume it might be an infection that mimics the symptoms of diabetes. I've been feeling this way for about 4 days now. Right before this I felt perfectly healthy. I'm from a low income family so I kinda grew up eating crap and I still kinda do. I also usually do ingest a large amount of sugar and I have a family history of diabetes so I know I'm at a pretty high risk. I'm scared to tell my family because I don't want to burden them financially, and to be honest I'm terrified of needles! Before this, I've always been very healthy despite my eating habits and I've barely been ill in my entire life. I'm just kinda scared to accept the fact that I'm no longer healthy and that I'll probably never be able to eat anything sugary ever again. I've googled diabetic diets and it just seems so limited. I'm so angry at myself and I wish I could go back and change my habits. Does anyone have some advice? I'm so worried and scared. Not to mention my birthday is less than a month away and I want to be able to eat birthday sweets.

Over time, this vicious cycle can lead to persistently elevated blood glucose levels, or type 2 diabetes...\"\"...the level of glucose in the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding your brain is always about 60% as high as the level of glucose in your bloodstream\u2014even if you have insulin resistance\u2014so, the higher your blood sugar, the higher your brain sugar...\"\"...While most brain cells don\u2019t require insulin in order to absorb glucose, they do require insulin in order to process glucose. Cells must have access to adequate insulin or they can\u2019t transform glucose into the vital cellular components and energy they need to thrive. Despite swimming in a sea of glucose, brain cells in people with insulin resistance literally begin starving to death...\"\"...Which brain cells go first? The hippocampus is the brain's memory center. Hippocampal cells require so much energy to do their important work that they often need extra boosts of glucose. While insulin is not required to let a normal amount of glucose into the hippocampus, these special glucose surges do require insulin, making the hippocampus particularly sensitive to insulin deficits. This explains why declining memory is one of the earliest signs of Alzheimer\u2019s, despite the fact that Alzheimer\u2019s Disease eventually destroys the whole brain...\"Inflammation is a direct cause of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a direct cause of Type 2 Diabetes. And, now, they've connected the dots between Alzheimer's and insulin resistance. The test for insulin resistance is the measurement of fasting blood glucose, A1C and insulin levels.Insulin resistance is treated by \"lifestyle modifications\" and in some (most) cases, \"medications\".If the treatment of insulin resistance is through \"LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS\", and, it has been ridiculously well established, now, how utterly vital it is to NOT TO BE INSULIN RESISTANT... then, why be vague about the treatment of INSULIN RESISTANCE?

Don't you think it's a wee bit odd, every single post, here, ends with the question, \"Should I be worried...?\" They are worried because they are CLUELESS. They are worried because they have no idea how to properly treat Type 2 Diabetes (aka, insulin resistance)...The truth is, nobody knows what \"insulin resistance\" is because nobody cares! But, when your lower legs and feet feel like they're on \"fire\", when you start to lose sight in an eye and, worst but not least, when you accuse your spouse of hiding your car keys or glasses, that's the time we should learn about \"insulin resistance\"? Obamacare or Trumpcare; what difference does it make? No insurance can possibly \"cover\" what insulin resistance does to the human body. Not one word in any medical insurance coverage addresses the prevention of \"insulin resistance\". And, the treatment of insulin resistance, now, represents 8% of our entire Gross National Product! Gee, if we could understand what \"lifestyle modifications\" meant, what could we do with almost a trillion dollars? If any disease \"progresses\", that means it getting WORSE. If you're doctor is having to increase the dosage of drugs, prescribed, that means it's getting worse. Of course, it's every patient's \"fault\" their disease is \"worsening\". They're the ones not following \"instructions\". They're the ones, not losing weight! We are know, patients are \"weak\" and without \"discipline\"...So, why be vague? If the treatment for insulin resistance is \"Lifestyle Modifications\", why not spell it out like we're 5 year olds? Why must people be \"worried\" about Type 2 Diabetes?Answer: Because. Nobody cares enough (to demand the madness stop).On your next doctor appointment, tell your doctor, \"I don't want to be Type 2 Diabetic, anymore. Tell me what I need to do to \"reverse\" my diabetes.\"Just do it!<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

I am a 73 yr old, 20 year diabetic.When I finally retired and was able to eat what I wanted to, I lost weight and my blood sugar readings dropped and stayed low. I eat good foods. I buy blueberries and other 'healthy' foods. When I get hunger or 'tasty', I simply eat something good from my pantry. Since I like all the things I buy (for the most part), My hunger is satisfied. When I go out, I eat basically anything I want; although most of what I choose is good for me.Now, having done this for awhile, I am 40+ pounds lighter, my AIC in the 6.3area.What I am trying to say is that by surrounding myself with quality good foods and eating foods FOR the goodness they contain, I have brought my diabetes in check. For breakfast today I'll have oatmeal with blueberries and raisins. Later, I'll eat a small tomato and two apricots (the tomato because I know it is good and the apricots before they go bad). I brought an avocato because of it's good fat, I''ll eat it later or tomorrow for sure. Simply put I buy and eat foods that are listed as good for diabetics and then eat them because I need the nutrients. I may grab a few dates and a tomato.Later I will eat celery and peanut butter. Later still I will take my delicious $5loaf of 9 grain and make a sandwich of chicken with loads of veggies.When I go out, I basically eat anything I want; very seldom is it a hot greasy cheeseburger.I only buy nutrious things. No chips, no soft drinks, rarely ice cream, good choices of meat (the -loins, etc. and not much), only healthy cereals, always guided by nutritious values.My diet is a way of life for me. I am aware that I choose the things I eat for health reasons not necessarily taste. But the truth is there are many things that are good for you and filling yourself with what you should eat is easier than you imagine. Try it, for the next week eat only 'good stuff'. Two eggs and great bread with juice. Later eat a raw tomato and some grapes. Keep eating good stuff all week- force yourself. If you can focus on the nutrientswhen you shop, it follows that you will eat them if available. Soon this will be the way you eat. It is a small difference, but it could change your life.You will learn to eat many small items over the day and rarely overeat.Simply put, By filling your shelves with 'good' foods and forcing yourself to eat them, you'll just naturally become slim and healthy, diabetic or not.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

The countries with the least amount of available fresh drinking water suffer the greatest health threats. Lack of water is the most insidious and destructive form of malnutrition.People come to this board complaining of chronic, unrelenting symptoms. They've tried \"everything\".

How many diets? How are those drugs your doctor's prescribed for your diabetes; How's that working for you?Here's my suggestion that I know will work: FastingWhy does it work? Because, when you stop eating, your blood sugar levels not only decrease, your INSULIN levels decrease, too. So, why is that such a big deal? Because, insulin is the \"Fat Storage Hormone\". Insulin clears the bloodstream of blood sugar and places it in the liver (glycogen) and any excess glucose, in lipid cells as fat. The reason why bariatric surgery reverses Type 2 Diabetes well BEFORE you actually lose all the weight (in some cases, days after surgery)? You're not eating, anymore! You stomach has been stapled shut to the size of a walnut! Far less insulin is being produced and now your body can deplete glycogen stores in the liver and, then, go after the stored fat. Once excess bodyfat begins to be used as energy (in lieu, of food), blood sugar levels begin to stabilize almost immediately.Is fasting bad for you? Google it; Don't make me do all the work for you! Do you lose muscle when you fast? No. Does your metabolism slow during fasting? Not unless you decide to sleep in a cave for the next three months, no food. Is fasting expensive? Only for morons, it is. Are there rules for fasting? None that I know of? Should I fast without telling my doctor? Only if you know absolutely nothing about Diabetes or have difficulty making a phone call without assistance. The bottomline: If you lose weight, your Type 2 Diabetes will improve. If you stop eating, you will lose weight. 2+2=4 If you stop eating, your Type 2 Diabetes will improve. Fasting reduces insulin resistance...PERIOD!  PS: I just think it's very odd that nobody, out there, has responded to my posts, of late. All of them (posts) is centered around the same central theme: What if the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes has nothing to do with HIGH BLOOD SUGAR and everything to do with reducing INFLAMMATION & INSULIN RESISTANCE? Ie. What if the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes was LOWERING insulin levels, not raising them (which most diabetes medications are designed to do)?Then, that would mean, all these millions and millions of people who've been taking pills to \"artificially\" lower high blood sugar were actually doing nothing to stop the \"progression\" of Type 2 Diabetes. Then, that would mean, that they're symptoms would worsen over time despite making every effort (thru diet, exercise, stress management, etc) to keep them at bay. Then, that would mean, as taxpayers, we're paying billions of dollars in faux treatment protocols, that simply just don't work. In fact, the population in the US is getting fatter and more diabetic......and, who would receive all this trillions in money, either directly or indirectly, designed to treat Type 2 Diabetes? Medicine and Pharmaceuticals, that's who.We have a doctor, here, now. Not one word. Nobody, not one word in defense of present day treatment of Type 2 Diabetes? Say, \"Bahhhhhhhhhh\".

Insulin resistance in the liver leads to more glucose production, whereas the resistance of the peripheral tissue means that glucose uptake is impaired.Obese male abdomen.Obesity can lead to insulin resistance - usually a precursor to the development of type 2 diabetes.Damage will stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin, but the final pancreas can not be enough to prevent blood sugar levels rise too high.Genetics plays an important role in type 2 diabetes - the relatives of people with the disease are at a high risk, especially among the American Indians, Hispanic and Asian populations.Obesity and weight gain are important factors that lead to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, which play an important role in genetics, eating habits, exercise and lifestyle.

Now, how itf can something bad for your health, in large amounts, be good for you, in \"moderation\". lol Kinda like like eating poison mushrooms or produce with pesticides, how can eating a little bit, not only be OK, but actually good nutrition? Intuitively, that's a tough nut to crack, right? And, now, decades after the first studies about those self-righteous \"Mediterraneans\" :)...the experts are beginning to reverse course. Maybe, what's bad for you in large amounts, may actually be bad for you in small amounts, too. But, don't worry, just, yet. For all the \"social\" drinkers, out there, reading this, take heart! My guess, is there'll be plenty of \"rebuttal\"studies, forthcoming, soon. Take comfort in knowing the beer, wine and spirits guys will not go quietly in the night! Distillers are not going to knuckle under to public pressure like the cigarette and soda folks, before them. When it comes to protecting \"turf\", these dudes are tougher, more ruthless than the NRA. So, drink up and tell yourself its \"good\" for your diabetes...at least for a while longer.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

(aka Eat More Fruits and Vegetables)...Every diabetic has heard their doctor say these words. They say it at the end of every appointment. They say it, like it's as easy as, \"Don't leave the house without your cell phone\", or, \"Don't forget to brush your teeth twice a day\". But, anybody can brush their teeth twice a day. Very few, though, can \"eat more fruits and vegetables\". Why? Because,1. Process foods are easy. Hand over the money, toss it in the microwave. You'll be eating in less than a few minutes.2. Process foods are tasty. It's loaded with sugar and salt, the most subliminally addictive \"legal\" compounds in the world. Do you think manufacturers don't know this? 3. Process foods don't spoil. No need to throw away processed food because it's got \"preservatives\" (some people actually think this is a \"good\" thing!). 4. Process foods are cheap. Pancake mix? Cheap!. Crackers? Cheap! White bread? Cheap! Tortillas? Cheap! Pasta? What's cheaper than pasta? How easy do you think it is to \"Eat More Fruits and Vegetables\" when most are not nearly as easy, tasty, can spoil in hours instead of months, and expensive (because it's got to \"cooked\" within a recipe that contains 9 other ingredients)? But, the biggest obstacle to \"E.M.F.V.\"? You have to actually perform WORK. Generally speaking, when you \"E.M.F.V.\", you have to shop, prepare, cook and clean up after each meal. In other words, it's a lot of work! A member said to me the other day, \"the reality is, most diabetics are just not capable of reversing Type 2 Diabetes...\" The sad truth is, he's right. People are \"too busy\". They have too many \"obligations\". They have too many \"mouths to feed\" and \"bills to pay\". They have too many trips to make and events to plan. They have to go back to school. They have to look for work. They have to buy a new car. They have to take care of their mom. They have to take their dog to the vet. Their kid was arrested for D.U.I.. They got arrested for D.U.I...yada, yada, yada. How can you eat more fruits and vegetables and still have time to live your life? So, when somebody posts a question about diabetes \"diets\" and \"diabetes friendly foods\" to recommend, just remember \"E.M.F.V.\". Unless you live in a cave, everybody, by now, has heard about the absolute critical importance \"Eat More Fruits and Vegetables\" has in treating Type 2 Diabetes. They already know what to eat. That's not the problem. What they're really asking is, what real foods can I eat that don't require any work, whatsoever, and are, of course, easy, tasty, fast and cheap? Sadly, if all fruits and vegetables were easy, tasty, fast and cheap, there would be no disease in the world. If you want to be free of Type 2 Diabetes, you have to pay the price.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

Six months ago my primary care Dr moved away so I was assigned a new doctor . My original Dr never done an EMG on me so my new Dr sent me to the neurologist so she could know for sure what's wrong with me. Since 2014 I've been dealing with every pain associated with nuerapathy its gotten worse to the point wear both of my feet are nearly 100% numb on the bottom soles and my toes are going completely numb as well. I'm having a hard time walking ,losing balance, body weakness, arms going numb, and elecrtic shocks in hands and arms,etc.. I've been on amatripiline, venaflaxine, gabepaten, lyrica, and cymbalta. Nothing has worked for me. I know there's no cure. I haven't been able to work in two Years. So I get my nerve test results back and my doctor tells me I can work any job that I want only restrictions is no lifting heavy machinery.

I closed the jar and let it marinate for 7 days on my kitchen counter. After most of the Gin was absorbed by the raisins, I placed the covered jar in the refrigerator. (This process is usually recommended for people with Arthritis).After I took my diabetic medicine at bedtime, I also took nine (9) raisins.

The immunological basis explained ...  Simplified version:Strange idea? May not be for people familiar with food allergy treatment.Peanut protein patch applied to HEALTHY skin is a treatment for peanut allergy.One of the ways peanut protein applied to skin works, is the generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs) specific to peanut.Tregs regulate/moderate the immune system's reaction to peanut exposure.One of the causes for type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a reduction in the number of Tregs in the pancreas. This allows CD8+ T cells to attack the islet cells, unrestrained, causing T1D. Why chicken soup?As explained in the articles below, chicken protein is the most likely source of the proteins that train the CD8+ T cells to attack the islet cells. We need chicken protein specific Tregs to restrain them.     The potential solution is to create chicken protein specific Tregs by topical chicken soup. Why topical and not drinking/eating chicken soup?Tregs are trained to home to a part of the body.Eating/drinking chicken soup generates Tregs that home to the gut.Topical chicken soup generates Tregs that home to the skin.As described in the articles above, the CD8+ T cells that attack islet cells are trained to home to the skin. But it turns out the pancreas attract these cells by producing the same chemical attractant as the skin.Therefore skin homing Tregs produced by topical chicken soup will also home to the pancreas just like the CD8+ T cells. Going by the peanut patch experience, it could take up to a year to see the effect ... if it works.IMPORTANT: Never apply food proteins to damaged skin, only to HEALTHY skin.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},
