Family history, age, race, lifestyle, all, have to be investigated.  You can be diagnosed with prediabetes or Type 2 Diabetes but not show abnormal blood sugar levels, did you know that? \"Metabolic Syndrome\" is a condition that you should come to understand. It is also known as \"prediabetes\". There are 5 factors to be considered: Obesity, High blood pressure, High blood sugar, High triglycerides & Low HDL Cholesterol. If you have ANY three of the 5 factors, you are considered \"prediabetic\". ANY 3 (it doesn't need to be high blood sugar!).  This is why diabetes is so closely associated with advancing age. Its closely tied to natural changes in hormone levels associated with older people. But, you can mess with the natural aging process, ie., you can accelerate aging, when you stop performing healthy habits. Like eating real food. Or, exercising. Or, balancing work with family. Or, getting reasonable sleep, every night.  The greatest health threat that doctors see in their patients, today? \"Common sense\". People think they can get away with any lifestyle, imaginable. And, the human body will eventually \"tire\" after years of reckless, thoughtless treatment.  People think that Type 2 Diabetes causes poor health. Wrong. It's poor health that causes T2 diabetes. If you get serious about improving your health, sugar levels, blood pressure, triglycerides and belly fat will fall. That's the greatest misconception I see on this board.  You don't \"treat\" lifestyle diseases, most especially, T2D... You \"treat\" your body and your body will go back to performing a proper job.

The amount of fresh produce, meats, diary, seafood and teas/health food vs. processed foods?  About 1 : 1  In American grocery store?  About 1 : 6  The obesity rate in Japan? 3.5% The obesity rate in the US? 30%  In Japan, it's national policy to eat fresh food and cook at home, everyday...  In the US, nobody cooks, everyday, and when \"cooking\" at home, its often with a microwave.   In summary, your body can heal, itself, if given the proper nourishment in fresh, real foods, ie. \"perishables\". On the flip side, a body fed with heavily processed, ie. foods containing preservatives designed to prevent spoilage, will weaken and eventually fall victim to multiple conditions. What does this all mean?  Food can be poison or medicine. Food can be your ally or your worst enemy. What does the average American know about eating a healthy diet?  It beats the hell out of me...<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

It will alarm if she is either too low or going down too fast. Also, an insulin pump would allow better control of insulin delivery. In a T1, when you go low, there is too simply much insulin. Now this can happen due to varying levels of insulin sensitivity which can happen for a variety of reasons. If she exercised heavily the day before, she will probably need less insulin the next day. If she has a day where she overall wants to eat a bit less, well that can take a toll too. It's not as simple as simply giving a set dose. You have to change things on the fly all the time.  I would suggest either \"Think Like a Pancreas\" by Gary Scheiner or \"Using Insulin\" by Walsh. These books will give her parents the skills to adjust her insulin properly so she doesn't drop like that during the night.  The bottom line is that the docs are right.

Let me explain that at Hypos there is not only low sugar, but Potassium by the body\u2019s reaction becomes also lower and I assume that this is creating the hangover feeling even the blood sugar is back to normal. I\u2019m daily supplementing Potassium with Slow-K 600mg by one day 1 Tablet the next day 2 Tablets and then 1 Tablet again to achieve the daily Av. of 900mg and this very successfully I\u2019m doing now for 3 months where my Insulin consumption got reduced to 1/3. During that period it did happen that I got Hypos because I got surprised by the Insulin reduction possible, but by knowing that at Hypos Potassium gets consumed, I acted by at Hypo 60mg/dl quickly take also 1 Slow-K Tablet, not only taking the right sugar amount and at Hypo 50mg/dl quickly take 2 Slow-K and at Hypo 40mg/dl quickly did take 3 Slow-K and by this I did not have any hangovers afterwards. Now after 3 months since I\u2019m in stabile conditions with that Potassium supplementing I do not have any Hypos anymore. Two Bananas have also 800-900mg Potassium. If we think this further, maybe it\u2019s possible to use Slow-K just at Hypos as an idea, because Bananas not so easy to keep. Potassium is also very important for the Glucose metabolism.

It is often difficult to determine the cause of cold feet or other issues involving numbing, tingling or coldness in your extremities. At an HBA1C of 7.5, it is highly likely that you have diabetic neuropathy. Neuropathy can also be caused by spinal problems.  IMHO, you would benefit from seeing a neurologist. You also need to work with your doctor and make an effort to reduce your HBA1C. Consider seeing a certified diabetic educator, nutritionist or dietician for guidance.

That said, I have been diabetic for decades, and both Type 1 and Type 2 are generously interspersed throughout generations of my family.  Pain is pain regardless of source. Patients owe it to both themselves and their families to do everything possible to be able to function at their respective highest level - whatever that is. Diabetes and diabetic neuropathy can cause intense and often debilitating pain. Unless you have experienced it personally or even cared daily for someone who has, it is - at best - difficult to appreciate. Applying labels - or implying that taking insulin will always escalate into needing more insulin in and of itself - is not the experience of me or anyone in my family. Worse, those without diabetes with whom I work who THINK they know all about diabetes have done more damage and prejudice in the workplace than any other single type of action. While their intentions are admirable, their lack of knowledge has proved dangerous at best.  Bottom line: work with a good endocrinologist, BUT do whatever is necessary to control pain. Once the pain is tolerable, other improvements can begin. If pain meds can be later decreased or eliminated completely, so much the better. However, improvements while in pain are difficult to implement and even more challenging to maintain. If pain meds must be increased temporarily or permanently, doing what is best to function to the highest extent possible is what has been best for everyone in my family. Whether it is opioids, cannibas - whatever, do what works, and keep trying alternatives until you find something that does.  Finally, because of the obvious lack of thought and consequence spent reviewing posts, this will be the last time I EVER check this diabetic information as a source.

{"threadId": "Diabazole", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    This is most definitely NOT a \"winning\" supplement. It is typical of many scams online that target people with chronic diseases. Common tip-offs that are associated with scam products (including this one) include: 1. The \"free trial offer\" is just that: a free TRIAL. If you opt to keep it, you will be billed the regular price; often that is IN ADDITION to the original postage&handling that you paid up front. 2. When you use a search engine to look for user \"reviews,\" you'll find many dozens (if not hundreds) of fake reviews singing the praises of the supplement; most of them are either \"seeded\" (i.e., planted by the supplement/book vendor) or are on sites that will promote the item because they will profit from the sale (i.e., will receive a commission). 3. Trying to find the Nutritional Facts will often only display a barely readable thumbnail-like picture of the label but not a full-sized one that would enable you to research the ingredients objectively online. For Diabazole, here's the full ingredient list: Vitamin C (as ascorbic acid) Vitamin E (as tocopherol) Biotin Magnesium (as magnesium oxide) Zinc Manganese Chromium (as amino acid chelate) Guggul (10% guggulsterones) Bitter Melon (4:1 extract) Licorice Extract Cinnamon herb powder Gymnema Sylvestre herb powder Alpha Lipoic Acid Juniper Berry herb powder Banaba (1% extract) Yarrow Huckleberry herb powder L-Taurine Cayenne powder herb powder Vanadyl Sulfate  4. Some of the ingredients have shown to have some slight merit in lowering blood sugars in \"some\" patients (small percentage). Many have roots in Ayurvedic (Indian) medicine that dates back hundreds of years. However, that was before the introduction of processed foods and its toxic chemicals (added sugars, preservatives, coloring agents, and other harmful ingredients). Other ingredients are potentially harmful when used on a long term basis (high on the suspect list is Vanadyl Sulfate). And you if need some food for thought, if the Ayurvedic ingredients are so beneficial, why does India currently have a diabetes epidemic on its hands (65 million diabetics and growing!)? Surely Indians would be taking/using their own supplements if they actually brought down blood sugar levels to meaningful, safe levels.  5. But how can you tell if its a scam? Read the fine print. The \"free bottle\" is limited to a very short window; if you keep the bottle beyond the trial window, your credit card will be billed the full price of the supplement. And what's the REAL trial period? In this particular case, it is fourteen days and that is not 14 days in which you can actually try the product. It is 14 days from the DATE of your original order. If it takes up to 5 days for the product to arrive at your doorstep and you don't actually start taking it until the following day, it means you only have 8 days for your actual trial. That's often not sufficient time for an evaluation.  6. Look for objective user reviews online. If a link to actually buy the supplement is embedded anywhere in the \"review,\" it's not genuine. User reviews never include links to a vendor's site; only to studies or other references. I often try to find it on Amazon first. Legitimate products are often sold by this vendor. If there are user reviews posted, I always start with the one-star reviews because they may be more pertinent than glowing praises from clueless users or shills.  7. Research each of the ingredients online in the Nutrition FAQs for a product. I have personally tried most of them and a few ingredients DID help in lowering my after meal blood sugar levels. However, if you think that lowering your blood sugar levels a whopping 0.2% is cost-effective, I might recommend that you try taking a brisk walk around the block instead after meals. The walk will probably lower your blood sugars by 0.5% or more or better than twice as much ... without risking taking substances that could have long term adverse consequences including to your wallet!  8. I could go on and on but it is incumbent on you to do your own homework. However, a very reliable tip-off that a product is being over-hyped, over-priced, and may provide a very poor cost-benefit ratio is to simply close the vendor's web page. If you are greeted with a \"Wait, don't go!' type of message, and tempted with a significant \"one-time only\" lowest-price\" offer with two options: [Stay on page] or [Leave page], don't waste any time hastening your departure.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

Have they conducted basic blood testing? Are you over age 45? Are you overweight or obese? The diagnosis of diabetes involves not just whether you show abnormalities in blood sugar levels. It evaluates on the basis of diabetes \"risk factors\", too. Why? Because, people with Type 2 Diabetes often have no \"symptoms\". It creeps up on us in the dark.  Read, this, to get an idea what's considered to render a diabetes diagnosis:  http://www.joslin.org/info/how_is_diabetes_diagnosed.html    For example, did you know your dr could determine you have \"prediabetes\" even though you test normal for fasting blood glucose or A1C? Of course you don't. Nobody knows this because we're all \"internet\" doctors...  The problem with Type 2 Diabetes is it is a disease that incubates...silently. It develops under your nose and it usually takes a very long time, decades, even. It's estimated that as many as 100 million Americans have either prediabetes or diabetes but as many as 1/3 don't have a clue. They're \"ignorant\" of how the disease, manifests. They couldn't begin to explain what insulin resistance is and how one develops resistance to insulin depending on diet and lifestyle. All they know is \"high blood sugar\", \"high blood sugar\", \"high blood sugar\" and they have no idea that Type 2 Diabetes is \"reversible\". If you read the link, above, you'll get a glimpse of how involved a diagnosis of diabetes is, today...  So, if you've seen a doctor and discussed, at length, your concerns about whether or not you have diabetes, chances are high your situation is not your docs first \"rodeo\". Remember: 100 million. It's epidemic. 1 out of every 3 adults over the age of 45. Your doctor knows which tests to run and questions to ask to reasonably determine if you fit the Type 2 Diabetes \"profile\". And, if you don't, they may still refer you to a dietician of diabetes specialist to help you make adjustments to your diet and lifestyle to help you reduce your body's developing \"insulin resistance\". You see, a Type 2 diagnosis is fast approaching end stage uncontrolled blood glucose regulations. The present day criteria of when you \"need\" to do something about your developing diabetes is, laughably, far too late! It's 12:00 and the bar closes at 2:00. It's the 4th quarter in the Superbowl. Should you suspect you have diabetes because you have a \"sweet taste in your mouth\"?  good grief, you should suspect you have diabetes when you wake up every morning and pour that first cup of coffee! Understand the diabetes \"risk factors\". Then, explain them to your kids. Lose the weight. Stop eating out and learn to cook healthy meals. Manage your stress. Exercise, daily, and \"prepare\" for your sleep, every night, as if your life depended on it. It does. Understand that preventative medicine is not on anybody's agenda for good reason. People want your hard earned money and, right now, taking it from you is like shaving sheep. Let's all say, baaaaaaahhhhhh.

You can find tons of lchf recipes online through a simple google search.  And on an even more positive note, the science is beginning to bear this out. A recent studied showed that after about 6 months or a year, lchf patients when compared to the low fat crowd, did about the same in all their metrics. Except in a few areas, the lchf did better.  Regarding cholesterol, the lc people didn't have their cholesterol drop quite as much as the low fat folks, but that was only at the beginning. By the end of the study, they had pretty much the same good chl profile, except the lc people tended to have lower triglycerides.  Apparently in the weight loss department, lc people lost more weight. As it was not a long term study, they didn't know who kept it off better. I have seen quite a few T2s maintain good weight loss by sticking to this.  It is excellent for bg numbers - better than high carb low fat people tend to be as even carbs with a lot of fiber will spike your bgs.  Dr Bernstein was the first lchf guru - but many people only use him as a guideline as his mode of this diet is very, very, very extreme. I personally couldn't live on only 30g of carb per day. Nor would I want to.  But following this plan will definitely help keep your blood sugars in check. It appears to be that the combination of the carbs and the fat (think pizza with lots of cheese, etc) are what is really horrible for your health.  My Dad follows a low carb diet and has done amazingly well for the last 40 years. But that is what suits him and his lifestyle. You will have to find what works for you.

Sounds like your body can't handle large doses; test that theory by giving yourself (in your 10 unit example) 5 units with another 5 in 30 minutes. Your doctor put u on 70/30 after your telling him u can't afford pump supplies. You could inquire to go on straight NPH rather than a pre-mix but if your A1-C is good on 70/30 continue just break up your doses. In honesty when I was shooting 3x a day I used the same syringe; now on the pump I change infusion set every 6 days instead of 3. Neither case is ideal but since insurance calls the 'supplies' durable equipment I need to pay 20% so this way a 90 day supply becomes a 180 day supply about $15.00 a month. I know this was an unconventional response but if splitting doses by syringe doesn't work don't take risk with your heart.

Chronic inflammation is at the root of every single lifestyle disease, today. Cancer, hypertension, arthritis, glaucoma...they are simply different \"expressions\" of the same root cause: A weakened immune system caused by chronic, systemic inflammation. Why do some people look their age where others can pass for their kids brothers and sisters? Take a guess. I believe aging is a disease that can be \"reversed\", too. Does your age affect the bruise on your knee or your Type 2 Diabetes?  Does a bear...?  Anything that \"taxes\" your immune system affects all other ongoing conditions in your body. This is why your blood sugar may flair because of the \"boo-boo\" on your knee. Your immune system is in inflamed and, presently, addressing infection at the injured area. Will this compromise your body's ability to regulate blood sugar?  Does a bear fart in the woods?  Do hospitals refrain from performing surgery when a patients diabetes is uncontrolled? Yup. You should google the word \"sepsis\" oand how many people die from it each year in hospitals each year.  You got it wrong. The bruise and diabetes are both affected at the same time because they are both regulated by the same \"mother\"...your immune system.  This is how I \"reversed\" my Type 2 Diabetes. It's the day when I realized I needed to stop \"treating\" my Type 2 Diabetes and focus on improving my \"health\". This is the nasty, dirty secret that nobody in the medical community wants you to know. This is why they eliminated P.E. in schools. This is why we're forced to endure these lame TV commercials showing \"gorgeous\" older men and women blissfully prance around because they take the latest diabetes \"wonder\" drug (that hasn't been recalled, yet).  And, this is why you asked this question. Because, there's big money to be made from people who are old and in poor \"health\". I'm 61 yo and I had to learn this life lesson on my own. Because, healthcare does not want you (and, more importantly, your kids) to know the answer to your question.  PS: One of my dogs was suffering from diarrhea, recently. It was sporadic and unpredictable. This was killing me because I had to take him outside at god-awful times in the middle of the night and it's not safe because we have coyotes wandering all over the neighborhood, then. I could have taken him to see a vet but I knew all they would do is prescribe an anti-diarrheal (ie. \"imodium\") because my dogs are well cared for and in peak health, most times. It took me close to a month to figure out what was wrong but I finally nailed it. Did you know that bloody stools can be caused by a simple ear infection? And, he never had this problem, before, even though I've been treating his ear mites for YEARS?  Did you know that perfectly healthy seniors can die within days from a simple uterine tract infection or a tooth ache?  It's all stems from the same bowl of fruit. Sadly, it's so much easier to \"treat\" diabetes than it is to drink only water or stop eating bread with a meal. That's what it really comes down to. Improving lifestyle and daily exercise is a bich.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

As you dig deeper into the relationship of these three terms, you will learn there's a connection between high blood pressure, obesity, high cholesterol and Type 2 diabetes! They are all related through \"metabolic syndrome\" and they are all just \"symptoms\" of developing \"insulin resistance\".  It clearly states in the article that an individual can be insulin resistant yet show no signs of Type 2 Diabetes. I am, in fact, such a person. I use to be diabetic but I \"reversed\" it. I have not failed a blood sugar test (fasting or A1C) in over 10 years. Am I insulin resistant? Hell, yes. Am I still Type 2 diabetic? Not to my doctor, I'm not. Do I have metabolic syndrome. Nope. I use to be. But, when I reversed my Type 2 Diabetes and lost 44 pounds, my blood pressure and triglycerides all reduced to normal levels.  imho, there isn't a person consuming a Western diet, that is not \"developing\" insulin resistance. High levels of insulin circulating in the bloodstream is the indicator that insulin resistance is \"incubating\". When people disregard their diet, ignore developing signs of inflammation, fail to exercise, regularly, that's when insulin resistance can advance to prediabetes and, eventually, T2 Diabetes.  2 out of 3 adults in the US are overweight. Do they all have diabetes? No, not at all. But, are they developing insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome? You betcha! They all think they're \"safe\" because they don't show high blood sugar numbers. Little do they know, it's just a matter of time.  This is why I refer to Type 2 Diabetes is a spectrum disease: Everybody walks the same insulin resistance \"highway\". The further up the road, the greater your body's cells become resistant to insulin and, eventually, blood glucose begins to whack out.  This is not meant to scare you or anybody reading this. In fact, you should take comfort in knowing two things: 1. Everybody's in the same boat, and 2. The Type 2 Diabetes highway runs forwards and backwards! I'm living proof that that's true. You can cure \"it\" if you want to. Watch what you shove in your pie hole. Take long walks, daily. Listen to your body when it says, \"I'm sleepy\" and stop using a damn alarm clock. And, stop believing what every commercial on TV tells you is safe or healthy...  Cuz, clearly it's not.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

{"threadId": "Best Meal Plan for Type 2 Diabetes", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I do something kinda weird that most people would never dream to consider. About three months of the year, it eat avocados. Lots and lots of avocados. Morning, noon and night. Throughout the year, I also eat lots of celery with peanut butter. Two, three stalks, a day. I've been doing this for many years, now, and what I observe is pretty consistent, every time...  I lose weight. 10 pounds, sometimes more. I normally weigh about 175. I'm 5'10\" and, though, my weight loss is not noticeable to others, it's obvious to me. What also occurs during my avocado \"season\", my blood pressure goes down and so does my blood sugar, too.  The beauty of this diet change is it's simplicity. There's no cooking avocados or celery. There's no work.  What has this diet taught me?  1. Weight gain is due to water retention. Your body needs to retain water to help calm inflammation. Therefore, the cleaner and fresher my diet becomes, the less water my body retains. Just a single gallon at sea level weighs............. ........8.5 lbs! 2. Inflammation not only is a major cause of weight gain, it affects every other key vital, namely, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high blood sugar. This explains why gastric bypass patients can \"lose\" their high blood pressure and diabetes literally \"overnight\" (after operation). They can't eat crap, anymore (sugar, carbs, red meat, diet sodas, \"lunchables\", cereal, pasta, sourdough bread, etc...)  They can try. But, the most they can handle is a bite, maybe two. This means their entire G.I. tract gets a 6 month Hawaiian vacation to rest and heal. This means they can't \"sabotage\" themselves. 3. Fiber is your stomach's friend. People that eat food with labels have a entirely different gut flora (bacteria) than people that don't. The more fiber you eat (fruits and vegetables) the less inflammation your body will experience through digestion and sleep. The less inflammation your body needs to \"repair\" each day, the sooner your health can be restored. Bacteria outnumber the number of human cells in a human body, 10 to 1. This means some bacteria is good and some bacteria is bad and what you eat determines which ones decide to take up residence inside you. 4. It's not too much sugar that ruins lives. Just ask any woman Type 1 Diabetic how they feel about \"insulin\". The more they use, the fatter they get. They do not like that. High insulin is inflammatory!  I don't \"recommend\" diets to, anyone, anymore. There's no point. If you don't understand the \"why\" (you're doing something), you will not continue (to do it).  You \"think\" your overweight is due to diet. You \"think\" your diabetes is due to diet. You \"think\" your hypercholesterolemia is due to diet. So, let me ask you a question: If all of these \"bad health problems\" are all due to poor diet, why hasn't somebody come up with a diet that improves all three?  They have, dear. People just can't stop shooting themselves in the foot. Life without bread or sugar, sucks, is all.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

Everybody's pulled a lizard tail, off, at some point during our pathetic little lives, right? Or, removed a spider's legs and saw them doing perfectly fine the following week...with replacement legs. Starfish, ditto. Elephant tusks and deer antlers, same...yadda yadda yadda. The healing power in nature can be observed by any schmuck willing to stop staring into their stupid cellphones.  Cherry, do you think there's a drug store for reptiles? You think they run to GNC for vitamin B12? Do you think starfish \"treat\" their missing limbs when some stupid kid comes by and pulls it off?  There are 640 different muscles on the human body. Damage, tears, deterioration is occuring on each muscle on a daily basis! But, do any us ever stop and give praise to the miracles our bodies perform, 24/7/365, for all the years we walk this earth? This is \"regeneration\" at it's finest and, yet, every diabetes forum on the net has people asking the same question: \"Uhhh, wha shud I 8?\"  We are better, more miraculous, than lizards or starfish. All we need to do to reverse our Type 2 Diabetes is help our bodies heal, itself. Take a break from putting holes in our boat and allow our bodies to take care of the rest. Last year, the medical profession reaped in $250 billion is costs associated with \"treating\" diabetes. This is why I have no sympathy. You can't educate people who \"choose\" to be stupid.

{"threadId": "Type 2 Diabetes can be reversed", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Thanks cherry99. It is good to know.  The principles of reversal of T2 Diabetes is nothing new. Conventional approach to medicine is to address the \"SEED\", ie. stop the cause of the disease. What is so messed up about the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes, today, is doctors have patients manipulating their blood sugar.  Although I wholeheartedly agree that chronic high blood sugar is destructive to the human body, it's not the \"cause\" of T2 D. The cause of T2 D is chronic inflammation due, IN PART, to high insulin. This is an important distinction. imho, millions of people are \"treating\" a symptom of inflammation. High blood sugar is simple a \"byproduct\" of chronic inflammation. That is the equivalent of putting ice packs on patients with the asian flu. Fever is bad, sure, of course...but it's not the damn cause of the flu. It's caused by a virus. Hence, we get \"flu shots\" to pre-produce antibodies within our immune systems in preparation for when we are exposed to this year's flu. Vaccines are an example of \"SOIL\" approach in medicine. Instead of addressing the disease (aka \"seed\"), we make our bodies inhospitable to a developing/progressing condition to halt it's progress. If you make your body infertile to Type 2 Diabetes it makes it \"die and go away\". In other words, the soil is not conducive for further growth (of the disease).  Seed or Soil. Makes no difference to me what y'all do. I got mine. And, it didn't cost me my sanity, either.  PS: Here's a little article that I hope you'll find fascinating...  https://www.drmcdougall.com/2013/12/31/walter-kempner-md-founder-of-the-rice-diet/  Kempner wrote this in 1939. 1939!

{"threadId": "Type 2 Diabetes can be reversed", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                Brunosbud, Thank you for the link from Dr. Kempner. It\u2019s interesting and this especially for me because for a long time I eat every day about 100\u2013150 grams Rice. What cannot been put into a bottle with label and sold is not important for the medicine industries.  About your inflammation interpretation at Type 2 It seems you got mixed-up with something and formed a wrong conclusion. There is no nih.gov evidence that Insulin is creating inflammations, contrary it is anti-inflammatory. There is evidence that High Blood Sugar causes inflammations by micro-macro-vascular disorders and Beta Cells and Insulin Receptors at Cells get destroyed or reduced resulting to Insulin Resistance. Eliminating inflammations as you mentioned is important. To reduce inflammations Sodium Salicylate is also used, because it does not have the same internal bleeding risks as Aspirin has. See the link where Insulin is anti-inflammatory:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3992527/ In the link is also written: In this sense, hyperglycemia is pro-inflammatory whereas insulin is anti-inflammatory.  I think you have to rethink your Type 2 interpretations.  Sure the inflammations at Type 2 should been eliminated, but for this the micro-macro-vascular disorders everywhere in the body need to be eliminated by normal Blood Sugar. The body by the nature is not made for bodyweights of 200-300 lbs that should everybody be very clear. In all the Type 2 discussions I\u2019m missing that not everybody is digesting the same and there is no standard test for this. Some People by its genes have a high velocity digestion with poor nutrients absorbing and some People have a very slow digestion with a very high nutrients absorbing as at OB Type 2. The same can be seen at some native Indio\u2019s which by its genes have a very slow digestion for food of Plants and Fish, not made for today\u2019s high carbon super markets civilization foods and so nearly all OB and Type 2 Diabetics.  It shows the importance of the right kind of foods, but it also shows if the genes are for very slow digestion, that a correction or normalization by bariatric surgery should been recommended.  I found out something important about Potassium. I have not the typical Type 2 problem and for not getting more underweight I need daily CH of 240 grams, because I have a high velocity digestion. I followed the good advices of WDHCO and resulting have a healthy A1C of about 5% without any potential for micro- macro-vascular problems. However the last two months started some tendency of initial swollen feet\u2019s and my systole blood pressure increased from always used to be 110-120 up-to 140-150, resulting checked the Thyroid, Lungs, Heart but noting was found. Lately at WDHCO I found the article about Potassium and tried it since one month and the swollen feet\u2019s reduced to normal and the systole blood pressure is now 130-140, but what really surprised me was that the Basal Insulin from 18-20 U did need to reduce to 10 U and the meals Insulin also to Halve Units. Maybe at typical Type 2 it shows also advantages. I don\u2019t know to where it will go over longer time, but it\u2019s also important that scientists say there is a deficiency of Zinc and Potassium in today\u2019s world population. Blaming sour-acid-rains for washed-out soil. Means Zinc and Potassium is also for healthy people important and good to take.  Happy Weekend<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

Not only did I reverse my T2D, I am a recovering smoker and alcoholic, too. In fact, the principals to beating all three are the same, cherry. I will tell you with out reciting any studies or articles, too (because you lose 99% of the readers when you do that).  Smoking is essentially \"nicotine resistance\". Alcoholism is nothing more than \"alcohol resistance\" So, what is Type 2 Diabetes? Type 2 Diabetes is \"insulin resistance\".  When you become addicted to any drug, the key to \"kicking the habit\" is to drastically lower or stop exposure to the drug, entirely, at which point you \"regain\" sensitivity.  1. I stopped smoking cigarettes. I'm no longer addicted to nicotine. I am nicotine sensitive, now. (yay!) 2. I stopped drinking alcohol. I'm no longer addicted to alcohol. I am alcohol sensitive, now. (yay!) 3. By \"reducing\" insulin through diet, exercise, water, sleep and many other lifestyle changes, I'm no longer Type 2 Diabetic. By reducing insulin, I've become \"insulin sensitive\", again. (yippee-kai-yay...!)  If what you say is true, cherry, then why not have all T2 Diabetics shooting up insulin? If more insulin is \"anti-inflammatory\" why beat around the bush with metformin and \"diet and exercise\"? Why not send all T2 newbies home with insulin pens from the get-go?  Here's another way of looking at it... Why does \"fasting\" work so beautifully with Type 2 Diabetes? Why does weight loss work so effectively in reducing insulin resistance? Why has gastric bypass surgery (where stomach size is shrunk to 1/10 its size) been observed to make Type 2 Diabetes miraculously disappear well before most weight is loss? Why does a ketogenic diet (high fats, no carbs) reduce blood sugar, within the first couple2 weeks of use? What do all four of these examples have in common?  Eat less (or eat no carbs)...use drastically LESS insulin...regain \"insulin sensitivity\". A1C and fasting blood glucose return to normal levels.    This is what I \"did\". No links to studies. No medical mumbo-jumbo. Its been 10 years; I stopped testing my own BS at home 3 years, ago. There's no point to do so, anymore. It's good. Every time...  So, go ahead and take more insulin if you like. You don't need to, actually. Just ask any insulin users, here, how \"anti-inflammatory\" their lives are. Just ask them what dosing MORE INSULIN has done to their body?...Their kidneys...Their eyes...Their joints and muscles...Their bladder and stomach...Their teeth...Their ears...Their fingers and toes... ...Forget the studies! Take a poll!  What we are talking about, here, is the fundamental problem with how Type 2 Diabetes is treated in America. People are not being instructed how insulin resistance develops and worsens! Diabetes drugs can help us reduce blood sugar to normal levels, sure, and that's a \"good\" thing. But, if you don't eat properly and \"rely\" on drugs to knock high glucose levels, down, you are advancing your body's \"insulin resistance\". That's a \"bad\" thing.  Type 2 Diabetes is when your body's cells have built a \"resistance\" to insulin. This is the phenomenon known as \"insulin resistance\".  How did I \"reverse\" my insulin resistance? I went low carb, low sugar, high fat. In a nutshell, I used LESS insulin!!!! I don't need to rethink this.

They've actually convinced us that treating a \"symptom\", like elevated blood sugar, actually does good!  The American (and Brazilian, too) Diabetes Society does not want us to reduce high insulin. They want us to reduce high blood sugar. More accurately, they want us to pay for expensive prescription drugs to reduce high blood sugar. If we actually treated the right thing, how could they (and, the pharmaceutical execs) afford their Tesla S P100D's? You see, reducing INSULIN levels is free. It costs nothing...  and, being such a benevolent folk, us Americans, we don't want people to lose their jobs. Of course, not!

There is currently no way to regrow body parts that have been destroyed (which is what is happening - your immune system is attacking the insulin producing cells of your pancreas). We can't grow back fingers or toes and neither can we grow back islet cells.  The sad truth is that as many as 50% of T1s diagnosed in emergency rooms had doctors visits the week before.  I just want to add, that you seem to be confusing T2 and T1. Your talk of weight and diet and exercise have nothing to do with T1. If you had been diagnosed with Lupus or Hashimotos thyroiditis you wouldn't be suggesting that because you have lived your life well this shouldn't be happening. So please try to ignore all the blaming commercials and media out there. It's not your fault.  Here's the good news. T1 will not stop you from doing anything in your life. It just will take a bit of organization. I suggest getting the books Think Like a Pancreas, and/or Using Insulin. They will tell you all you need to know about dosing your insulin. I was diagnosed in 1966 and am doing well.  Don't worry so much about Double Diabetes (as mentioned above). It can happen, but especially since you are newly diagnosed it's not something to worry about.  And finally, don't spend good money on the cures your see on the internet. These are scams where the only thing getting better is the scammers bank account.  eta: Look up LADA diabetes (Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults). The wiki page isn't bad. There are 2 average ages for the diagnosis of T1. 12, and 45. It just has a much slower onset in adults.  Cora<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

There are clocks everywhere you go. You have a mirror and a scale in the bathroom. Blood pressure meters cost $25? You can keep notes of changes (in your body &/or it's response to different variables) you observe. The point is this: You don't need anyone to tell you if you're getting better or worse. We can all do this, ourselves. So why isn't everybody doing this?  It's simple. Nobody makes any money when we do things on our own.  Be patient and watch your body.

{"threadId": "Diabetes or Anxiety", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Stress and anxiety is not great for one's health. Between work and family obligations, chronic stress and anxiety can easily insert itself into our daily routines. As a business owner, I was so used to immersing myself from one stressful situation to the next, even family vacations were \"hard\" on my body. At the time, I knew that was a pathetic state to be, but I endured it, nonetheless. I thought, \"What choice do I have?\"...  Now that I have \"reversed\" my Type 2 Diabetes, I can say this with little reservation. If you live a life under pressure, worried and tired, all the time, no matter how much you've achieved in life, from a health perspective, you've shot yourself in the foot. It's like driving a car a 100,000 miles without an oil change. It doesn't matter where you've traveled, what sights you've seen, you've driven your trusted \"wheels\" right into the ground. And, now, you're stranded on the side of the road (with your family, in tow) wondering what to do?  So, what are you gonna do? How are you going to get around, now, that ol' \"reliable\" can't be trusted, anymore? Do you think you can \"buy\" your wheels, back. Do you think you can rely on a \"mechanic\" to get your wheels spinning like a top, again. Maybe, you just want to putz around on and accept that the best you can do is a couple of blocks or three, maybe, before the engine overheats? Or, do you want to get your hands dirty, rebuild that engine from the ground up, and get your \"baby\" humming like the good old days? Do you think extreme emotional distress (of any kind) will make the problem go away?  I have no \"tips\" for you. \"Tips\" are for waitresses and losers. What I can say, is eating a healthy diet and reducing stress and anxiety absolutely, unequivocally contributed towards reversing my Type 2 Diabetes. ABSOLUTELY. UNEQUIVOCALLY.  And, if you pay lip service and half-ass the effort in these two areas, it won't work. And, nobody will know (or care) whether you cheated yourself, or not. That's the \"beauty\" in all lifestyle diseases. You can't have your cake and eat it, too. People view diabetes as a curse. But, for every curse they are always hidden gems to be discovered. You're \"terrified\" because you know nothing about this disease. Your fear is entirely unfounded. Wacha gonna do about that?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

Sorry, but increased weight by stress is impossible, but by increased intake well possible as known.

(This include a generalization, is therefore a simplified explanation, where at diabetics with none of any neuropathic symptoms (without any micro- macro-vascular disorders) the vasodilation is the same as at healthy people, because the nerves signaling is not hindered.

It\u2019s a very complex matter where the blood flow volume to the skin is also related to may possible micro-macro-vascular disorders. More studies need to be done.)

I recognize that this may be an unsatisfying conclusion for most reading this thread...and, yet, it is the only approach proven to be effective despite billions spent and decades of intense medical research into finding solutions for this disease.  The sad and unfortunate reality for the vast majority with diabetes is that they have only scratched the surface of their body's natural healing capacities. Health is like Alice's rabbithole. It is infinite in depth and the deeper you go, the more secrets you learn...about sleep...about exercise...about water...about stress...and, about FOOD!  Every person's diet is a intricate series of \"choices\". We make a multitude of both positive and negative choices, every freaking day. Pluses and minuses, 24/7/365. In simplistic terms, food can be destructive and inflammatory or it can be constructive, nutritious and anti-inflammatory.  Blood sugar spikes are just a reaction to inflammation, my friends. That's all it is. You are making more poor choices than good.  Therefore, any conversation about diet cannot be just about \"what foods should we eat\" without talking about \"what foods shouldn't we eat\". Because, here's the bottom line when it pertains to \"high\" blood sugar. Your lifestyle has more red on it's ledger (inflammation) than it does blue. In other words, for every step forward you gain for a healthy bite, you're more than likely, taking two steps back for two unhealthy ones. There will never be a magic bullet concocted for diabetes because medicine can't overcome every and all poor choice(s) in a individual's life.  This is the rabbit hole I speak of. This is what I refer to as \"lifestyle\". Every uncontrolled Type 2 is essentially shooting themselves in the foot. They are putting holes in their boat. They have seen the enemy and, it is them. Their \"inflammation\" is showing.  You take better care of yourself, your body WILL respond. Guaranteed. You make better choices (in place of the pss-poor ones you're make, now), you will glimpse \"cure\". This is the beauty of good health. That's the beauty of the human body. Thus, that's the beauty of diabetes. It is totally fair...just pluses and minuses, a zero sum game. You can be on the road to recovery, or the guillotine, with every decision you make. Choice is yours.  So, it doesn't matter how critical or insensitive jerks (like me) can be to you, your body NEVER JUDGES! Whether you care to acknowledge it, food is medicine. And, it is also poison. The choice is yours. The knowledge is available at your fingertips. Go down the rabbithole or remain ignorant...  How cool and fair is that? Take \"care\", please. Good luck<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

By beans with slow-carbs the digestion normally takes about 5-6 hours.

Especially the part on a diagnosis of T2 Diabetes/prediabetes can be made PRIOR to displaying high fasting blood glucose. In other words, when you begin to exhibit high fasting blood glucose, this is \"late\" stages of T2D. I was 51 when I was initially diagnosed. I reversed my T2D through diet and exercise; no drugs. I haven't failed an A1C in 10 years and stopped checking blood sugar several years, back. T2 D is a result on chronic inflammation, hormonal changes coming from advancing age and poor lifestyle fundamentals in rest and stress management. You can \"reverse\" obesity. You can reverse cancer. You can reverse high blood pressure. You can reverse T2D. My mom, 94, took blood pressure meds for 25 years. We made changes, together, and, now, she takes no meds. Lifestyle can positively affect genes responsible for the expression of the diseases mentioned, above. Period.  This board is about \"reactive\" medicine. This is what you're (and your md are) doing, now. You're reacting to a \"diagnosis\". What you don't realize is your body has been incubating the condition known as T2D for years, possibly decades. Much of this is the insistence of our population that being overweight or obese is \"not so bad\". They won't know what's \"bad\" until they try to sleep at night with degenerative neuropathy. Even , then, they say \"Oh, well...bad genes\" and continue to \"react\".  The Eagles demonstrated \"Proactive\" medicine. They showed you don't try to stop Tom Brady; he can't be stopped. The way to beat the Patriots is make Nick Foles into Tom Brady II. It worked and, now, they are superbowl champs. The Falcons and Seahawks lost because they \"reacted\" instead of being aggressive and keeping their foot on the gas pedal. They still believe that Tom Brady can be stopped!  This is the fundamental problem with how diabetes is treated, today. There's no aggression. Patients are \"treated\" despite failed lifestyles and diets. We all have to be accountable and take responsibility for the information we choose to bet the house on. My advice is to read this board, carefully. Go back a year. Then, you will see just how many houses are burning down (systematic med dose increases)and most of them believe they are following \"doctor's orders\".  Accountable means, \"Are my symptoms getting better or are they getting worse?\" Just ask yourself this question, \"Why are 80% of the T2 D/Prediabetes diagnosis occur after age 45?\" What does that tell you? You think dudes over 45 are \"unlucky\"? What is causing the expression of this disease \"late in life\"? The information is all out, there. Falcons or Eagles, your choice. Lose the weight and tell us what happens. If you resolve metabolic syndrome, no more T2 Diabetes. Eagles win.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

As you know , diabetes is a progressive disease; doing nothing will only have negative effects on your health. Work with the diabetes educator &/or a health coach to help you stay accountable and hopeful.  I would recommend trying to minimize the use of medications by losing extra weight, eating calorie restricted high protein meals at regular intervals. A diabetes educator can help you with this.  Forget eating 3 times a day and instead take your estimated daily calories and spread them throughout the day; space your meals every 3 hours.  Add exercise to your life, its as essential as your medications.  The use of exercise as a prescription helps you get fit, improves your body\u2019s use of insulin, improves blood sugars, and reduces the risks that a person with diabetes has for heart disease.  Commit to 3 days a week and build from there.  Find an exercise buddy if that helps, place your exercise appt in your schedule/appt book, start with something you enjoy\u2026walking, dancing\u2026just make it something that gets your heart rate up\u2026Its going to be uncomfortable at first but well worth the effort when you enjoy a healthier you  Cheers, Dr Bruni<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

Alcohol toxicity does not occur because you are on insulin. It occurs because you are irresponsible and drank far too much. True 'social' drinking is more than possible when on insulin.  Tell me Cherry, what do you know about insulin dosing? I:C ratios? Basal rates? Bolusing? Altered basals and bolusing depending on circumstances (athletics, stress, days without routine, shiftwork). It sounds more like you are afraid of something because you don't know about it properly.  Let's be honest, simply wagging your finger in the face of someone and telling them \"don't do that\", will most likely end up with them doing that the minute your back is turned. People are like that. But like most things, drinking a few alcoholic drinks can be done safely while on insulin. Test, Test, Test!<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

{"threadId": "Out of the Blue...", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Hi Cathy, Welcome to the wonderful world of confusion, the phenomenal ride of wondering if you'll ever understand your body again and the adventures of insulin. All joking aside, it can be a terrifying journey. It was for me. I was diagnosed T1 about 5 years ago. To say it was a transition was putting it mildly. I am disabled, so I am limited in exercise choices, and have a lot of allergies so it can be a pain to get fresh air exercise. I had to find a gym that could accommodate my disabilities and a trainer that was experienced in working with the disabled. Thankfully the VA was able to help with the cost or I'd be in the poor house by now. But anyway, when I started, my A1C was 9.6, and my BS was often in the high 200's. I had to not only change the way I ate, I had to retrain my whole family on how to cook and eat, and how to shop for those days when I wasn't able to do it myself. You already have that advantage, you have a healthy lifestyle. Now it's a matter of Carbs vs. Exercise vs. Insulin and when to do each. The best thing to do, is start a food journal that records your blood sugars, as well as your exercise routine (walking, gym, whatever). Your endocrinologist will probably tell you how many times a day to test, but I started with as soon as I woke up so I got my fasting sugar, before every meal, then 2 hours after every meal, and right before bed. I noted the times what my BS was and what I had eaten. It was the only way I could figure out what was causing the highs and lows. For example, for breakfast I had always had 8 oz of orange juice, and my sugars were always really high. For 3 days I skipped the OJ and my sugars were ok. So I changed the OJ I was used to and switched to a no sugar added, non concentrate, as fresh as possible, and my sugars were still high, so now it is a treat I get only on vacation once in a while. There are all kinds of things that I gave up, or only have on a cheat day. A lot of times if you forbid something all together, they become something you will crave until you gorge. If you cheat once in a while, i.e. once every month you can have a treat, then you don't break the diet. Now I've lost 40 lbs, still have 5 to go, but my A1C is 5.6 and my sugars are very rarely above 160. It's a balance of carbs. Oh by the way, when a food says sugar free, it doesn't mean it's completely sugar free. Check your labels. Under Carbohydrates the sugars could read Sugar Alcohol. This is sugar, just according to the FDA, it is not an actual food, so it doesn't count. It still affects the carb numbers. Good luck and God Bless.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

Everyone, imo, should learn how to test blood sugar, blood pressure (and make it mandatory for successful high school graduation).  Why? Because these two vitals are the LAST TO CHANGE (before you really begin that downward slide to adult pampers). Why is this important to know?  1. Because, by being aware of the importance of these two vitals and how to measure them, we could slash the entire medical bill of the US be 75% because everyone would know when it's time to go see a doctor!!! In other words, disasters would be averted, countless lives would be saved.  2. But, more importantly, it would drill into everybody's dense skulls that Type 2 Diabetes ain't something you \"get\"...like \"herpes\" or \"ringworm\". It would show everyone that diabetes is a \"highway\" that everybody frick'n walks! It's a spectrum disease!...and, by the time you start to see your blood pressure or your blood sugar start to \"elevate\", you're about a 10, 20, 30 years late in doing something about it.    Bottomline: I'm not gonna tell you if you have diabetes. If you had the sense, the gumption and the ingenuity to go out and buy a glucometer and test strips, all on your own, then, you already knew! You suspected. Your body was telling you years, before. You were noticing \"signs\" that weren't \"normal\"... ...aches... peeing... anxiety... loose stools... bad smells... insomnia... lost teeth... patchy, itchy skin... getting sick, missing work multiple times, each year...  You rationalized that \"that\" was normal. You chalked it up to \"old\" age. But, deep down, you knew something was off...  And, now, you know. Now, you're realizing. It ain't \"normal\".  But, don't freak. Because, if high blood pressure & obesity are \"highway\" diseases, maybe, just maybe, .....diabetes is, too. And, that would mean, everybody is riding the same sinkin' ship!  PS: I reversed my Type 2 Diabetes, 12 years ago. I'm 62. The last time I had a cold, flu or a sore throat was 5+ years ago.

You didn't do anything to get it, other than maybe have a genetic predisposition (about 18 genes involved) and sheer dumb luck.  Right now your immune system is attacking the insulin producing cells in your pancreas. And the sad truth is that for almost everything in the body, if we lose it, we can't grow it back.  So I'm very sorry to say that getting those cells back holistically, is sort of like holistically growing back your leg if it's been chopped off.  The bottom line with T1 is that you can/will live a long and healthy and fun filled life if you choose to do so and do a bit of work to deal with it. I would suggest 1 or both of the following books:  Think Like a Pancreas (by Gary Scheiner - a T1 who test drives every bit of technology before he talks about it) Using Insulin (by Walsh)  Oh, sorry but I just can't say this enough - it's a popular myth that eating gives you diabetes. That's normally reserved for T2, but no one can tell that by looking at you. T1 used to be called \"juvenile diabetes\" but they haven't for about 20 years because you can get it at any age. There are 2 average ages of onset of T1. They are 12, and 45 years of age.  So hang in there. You are going to be fine. T1 is not going to stop you from doing anything.

And, in each and every episode, Caesar shows every viewer, every time, the true crux of the problem: It's never the dog; It's the (dog) owner. More specifically, it's the owner's behavior, it's the owner's \"routine\", it's the way the owner \"thinks\", that's the root of the problem.  It's the owner that \"drives\" the very thing they love, that causes the animal to behave so destructively. And, because these people can't \"see\" how it's their behavior that ignites the negative behavior in their beloved dogs, the cycle repeats itself, over and over, until the family reaches a breaking point:  1. They give up and take the animal to the pound, 2. Their dog gets into a fight and injures another dog or bites the mailman (see \"Judge Judy\"; half the GD cases are about dog attacks!) 3. They decide to seek outside help and consultation (dog trainers, Caesar, dog \"classes\"...) 4. Their dog \"escapes\" (from their dysfunctional owner) and gets runned over or finds a new home...

Each member has their own personal reasons from doing so. It really does not provide any further level of privacy as we usually do not post personal information even if using our chosen user names. Some people just want their identity - even their private user name - kept private so chose this available option.  2. I appreciate your sharing your treatment philosophies for Type 2 Diabetes. What I fell I must comment on is your recommending specific medications. At one time, many years ago, your posts that do this would be deleted. However, standards have been relaxed and that is obviously now allowed. What you and all readers must realized is that not all prescription plans cover the medications you are recommending, or are available at a very high cost. For example, the Glucobay you have repeatedly recommended is a Tier 3 drug in the formulary on our plan and would cost $31.00 per month once the $405.00 annual deductible for Tier 3 and higher medications has been met. Some drugs, such as the Tresiba, is simply not covered and would cost us hundreds of dollars per month. Each patient needs to check with their insurance company and know what drugs are at what tier on their plans formularies before discussing it with their doctor.  3. Everyone must also realize that we are all individuals and must implement therapies that work for us. There are certainly sound general practices for treating Type 2 Diabetes or any condition, but the patients as a whole, with their full medical history, must be taken into consideration before prescribing any drugs or recommending any type of treatments.

Aging: Increasing age is a significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes begins to rise significantly at about age 45, and rises considerably after age 65.  Next, the doctor will investigate if you show diabetes \"signs & symptoms\".  The symptoms of type 2 diabetes due to high blood sugar may include:   Increased thirst  Increased hunger (especially after eating)  Dry mouth  Frequent urination  Unexplained weight loss (even though you are eating and feel  hungry)  Fatigue (weak, tired feeling)  Blurred vision  Headaches  Dizziness, Blackouts  Finally, if you show several risk factors, have a family history of diabetes & you're manifesting some diabetes symptoms, already, the doctor will further investigate by running A1C, fasting blood glucose and possibly glucose tolerance tests.  Point being, a person can show elevated fasting blood glucose and A1C levels yet not be diabetic. In other words, diabetes is never determined by glucose testing, only.

If she has been hospitalized seven times in eight weeks, clearly something is out of balance. In diabetics, gastroparesis is most often caused by neuropathy (nerve damage) of the vagus nerve. Neuropathy is a frequent and all too common complication associated with elevated blood sugars. That means people who have blood sugars that are \u201cabove normal.\u201d  You also state that after the hospital stabilizes her, she is sent home and \u201cwithin a matter of days,\u201d the cycle repeats. That begs the question: why hasn\u2019t anyone bothered to teach her how to \u201cstabilize\u201d herself? Why hasn\u2019t she learned it on her own? That\u2019s not meant to be critical; only to emphasize that managing diabetes successfully has always been 95% patient and only 5% doctor. The process is much, much easier than you or your daughter might think and perhaps we can go into aspects of this in a future post.  You seem puzzled that your daughter is suffering from all of her symptoms but her \u201cA1c is always good.\u201d You also state that you have been \u201cmonitoring her diet, sugar levels, and insulin, and all are in compliance.\u201d Unfortunately, \u201cin compliance\u201d begs the questions, in compliance with what? The terms \u201cnormal\u201d and \u201cin compliance\u201d is similar to the Food Industry\u2019s use of \u201call natural,\u201d \u201chealthy,\u201d and similar misleading terminology. The ADA guidelines for diet, blood sugar levels, and A1c levels are toxic for many of us. By using our BG meters and \u201ceating-to-our-meters,\u201d we have learned how to find out what works for us individually since we are all unique.  I should note that a \u201cgood\u201d A1c is possible even with uncontrolled diabetes. That\u2019s because the A1c is only an average of blood sugar bonding to RBCs that includes ALL glycated hemoglobin during periods of both high and low blood sugars. If your daughter is undergoing roller-coaster blood sugars that bottom out in the twenties or even lower (e.g., the DKA she experienced), then spiking up into the high 300\u2019s, 400\u2019s, or even higher, after a meal, the overall average might appear to be \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cnear-normal\u201d but she may suffer severe damage during her highs (and risking her very life when it drops too low). Here are just a few of the many questions that spring to mind: 1.&nbsp;Has your daughter adopted a low-carb diet (either LCHF or LCHP)? 2.&nbsp;Does she test her blood sugar level before meals and two hours after? If so, what are her average results? (note: I did not ask whether they were \u201ccompliant\u201d). 3.&nbsp;Does she test her blood sugar at bedtime? If it is high, does she take a corrective dose of insulin before going to bed? 4.&nbsp;Does her meal plans include the concept, \u201cEat-to-your-meter\u201d? 5.&nbsp;Does your daughter have a \u201ctarget zone\u201d for blood sugar levels before and after meals, at bedtime, and on arising (and how often does she meet her target)? Are those targets greater than two digits? 6.&nbsp;Is your daughter on the obsolete \u201csliding scale\u201d dosage chart for the insulin that she injects or is she on a FIT (Flexible Insulin Therapy) plan? 7.&nbsp;Does your daughter use a CGM and/or insulin pump?  Your daughter\u2019s situation seems like it would be greatly helped by improved education. As diabetics, we are all different. There is no \u201cone size fits all.\u201d It is essential for all PWDs to learn how things (food, exercise, and insulin) affect each of us individually. Then take appropriate action to keep everything in balance. It is not as difficult as it might sound.  I have been insulin-dependent myself for over fifteen years. Prior to starting insulin, I had pretty severe neuropathy and foot drop syndrome. After normalizing my blood sugars (and that\u2019s \u201ctrue normal\u201d; not the organ-damaging levels recommended by the ADA and many health professionals). My neuropathy began to fade within three months and reversed after about six. It took nearly two years, however, for a more complete recovery. My average A1c over the past fifteen years has varied between 4.8 on the low end and 5.4 on the high end. My target for both bedtime and fasting blood sugar levels is under 90 mg/dL and I am successful in reaching it the majority of the time.  One of the fastest-growing and largest diabetes support groups on Facebook for T1s is Type1Grit. Members there credit their remarkable \u201cnormal\u201d results on the \u201cDr. B protocols\u201d. \u201cDr. B\u201d is Dr. Richard K. Bernstein who laid out his guidelines or normalizing blood sugars in in his book, \u201cDr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars.\u201d You can read portions of the 2007 edition of his book online for free at diabetes-book.com (at the home page, just click on the menu tab, [Read Online]). Be sure to read his life story as well as the chapters on Food, Gastroparesis, and Chapter 7: The Law of Small Numbers.  Anonymous, if you read this post and would like to continue a dialogue, please post back. I have not frequented these message boards for quite a while but will check back periodically over the next two weeks to see if you have replied (don\u2019t expect too prompt a response, however). I am confident that if your daughter familiarizes herself about the \u201cDr. B Protocols\u201d and learns how to successfully apply them to her own situation, she can join the growing number of diabetics worldwide who have tamed their diabetes to live virtually normal lives. Better still, go to the Type1Grit board on Facebook and be pleasantly surprised to see how many T1s are managing their diabetes successfully.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

For example the Glucophage XR or SR original is not covered, but some allow the copy generic extended release products. For example there are only 3 Basal-Insulins available by the Lantus 22-23 hours replaced by the Toujeo 25-26 hours and the Tresiba up-to 48 hours where Basal means 24 hours effectiveness and this without any peaks causing Hypos. At Type 1 therapy we have since about 20 years now the medical standard of Basal-Bolus Therapy, where Bolus means the Rapid-Insulin to meals as NovoRapid, Apidra, Etc. At Type 1 who is using an Insulin-Pump, will usually only apply the Rapid-Insulin, because the Pump can simulate the Basal-Effect. If the old Glucobay is not covered by the stone age health plans then sure the very smart Januvia for Type 2 is also not covered. (Beside the Januvia would be good to replace your Glimepiride.)  We did mention this already, that the doctors by doing its best for the patients, often not getting respected by the Health Insurances.

{"threadId": "Pre-diabetic active vegetarian", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                Hi Shwetami, I was thinking some more and therefore like to express my opinion. Medical advices are here not permitted, but own experiences should been OK I hope. I don\u2019t think that you have Type 2, you possibly even a little underweight and by your vegetarian food therefore no Type 2. I see some similarities with my kind of diabetes just that you now 35 and I was over 60 when I got it. About your diet, I think reducing the carbs is not the solution, but you can try and see, because the fasting Glucose is from the liver and that one can daily produce up-to 500 grams and if the regulation is disturbed, maybe by lack of some hormones it can put it into the blood. Whatever diet you may apply, you need to take care of enough Protein, because the base of Hormones are Proteins. Especially for women is the right amount of Protein important, because otherwise possibly the monthly-cycles get disturbed, maybe just every 2-3 months and reduced or even completely stop. That\u2019s not good.  Per 2lbs bodyweight it needs 0.75g Protein and the best source of Protein is fresh Egg-White mixed in water to drink. One Egg-White has about 9 grams of Pure-Protein depending on the size of Egg. Add 2 Teaspoons of the Yellow to let it remain liquid at mixing. (As vegetarian your B12 is possibly also too low, be carefully.)  With this Protein maybe your fasting Glucose will get reduced and don\u2019t forget to eat daily also 2 Bananas, that\u2019s no joke.  When my diabetes started I was in the similar situation as you now. Did have fasting Glucose 115-120, but being a little underweight means I could not take Metformin what\u2019s the best to control or reduce the Glucose from the liver, because by Metformin the body will lose weight. Resulting together with my doctor decided to use \u201cToujeo\u201d the 24 hour Basal-Insulin and started daily by 6 U where by the producer info 8-10 U is usually the applied minimum dose and I got to 8 U to keep it below 100mg/dl at about 85-90 for the honeymoon period until some actions got into my diabetes where I ended-up with 23 U at peak and together with the doctor decided that this is too much and not even possible to control everything as necessary and so adjusted it to 18-20 U fasting Glucose 85-90mg/dl and additionally for the meals to handle got the Novo-Rapid Insulin and it was good so. During the last 3 months I\u2019m daily supplementing with 900mg Potassium Slow-K (equal 2 Bananas) and as very happy by this I could drastically reduce my Insulin consumption from \u201cToujeo\u201d 18-20 U daily to 6-7 U.   This here to give you some more detailed impressions and about what you may should talk with your doctor to decide, beside of further necessary tests to evaluate your kind of diabetes. Don\u2019t wait until diabetes confirmation, the defects start already at pre-diabetes and even the ADA agree to start therapy the sooner the better it is!

( https://www.healthline.com/health/diabetes/borderline-diabetes-know-the-signs#lifestyle-changes)  Do you understand the term \"insulin resistance\" and \"metabolic syndrome\"? If you did, you would know the relationship between high triglycerides, low HDL, high blood pressure, obesity (high belly fat) with high blood sugar. Insulin resistance is the driving force behind all 5 of these negative health conditions and prediabetes is defined by having at least \"ANY\" 3 out of the 5. So, what does this mean? It means you can be prediabetic (aka metabolic syndrome) without showing high fasting blood glucose.  PS: When you go to the grocery store, next time, notice how many people, over 40, exhibit reasonably good \"fitness\" and posture. When you come to understand about \"insulin resistance\", you will see diabetes in a whole new light. You will observe, as I do, that diabetes (metabolic syndrome) is a \"transitional\" condition. That everybody is in various \"stages\" of transition. imho, every man, woman and child is traveling towards Type 2 Diabetes...  And, that our understanding of just how important our lifestyle and, especially, diet plays in avoiding insulin resistance is essentially nonexistent.  Last thought: If you eat out, regularly, or you buy food that comes in any sort of packaging, how do you know, with \"certainty\", wth you're eating? This is why I believe lifestyle disease is by \"design\" ie., no accident. Everyone is so \"certain\". Good health and fitness, matters. Period.

{"threadId": "Diabetes", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Hello.  Standards now used by the medical community state that a fasting blood glucose reading over 125 indicates Diabetes. A fasting blood glucose reading between 100 - 125 indicates Pre-Diabetes. At this point, you can prevent your readings from increasing without medication by following a healthy diet low in carbohydrates as well as getting as much exercise as possible.  I am hoping that your doctor is trying to encourage you to change your lifestyle and does not believe this reading may not indicate Diabetes. If that is the case, you need to find a different doctor who is more aware of current research. An ideal fasting blood glucose reading is 80-100.  Genetics play a huge role in developing Diabetes. Given the family history you shared, you would be wise to change your lifestyle now rather than get to the point where you need oral medications and/or insulin.  If you don't have one yet, get a home glucose testing kit. If your doctor will not prescribe one or your insurance will not cover one, then many drug stores and other places like Walmart sell them for relatively inexpensive. Test your sugar every morning first thing after fasting for 10-12 hour an before eating or drinking anything but plain water.  Do your own research on the internet as well, and keep working to lower your readings. You are in charge of your health and the results will be based on your choices and actions.

{"threadId": "Alpha lipoic acid", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Based on recent studies, in order for alpha lipoic acid to be effective in reducing pain due to neuropathy, your blood sugar levels must be normalized, FIRST.  First things, first. Have you achieved normoglycemia (normal blood sugar levels, regularly)? Is your blood sugar under tight control at this time?  Why is this important? Because, alpha lipoic acid appears to boost systemic \"anti-oxidant\" levels. High or uncontrolled blood glucose does the exact opposite. This is why your doctor emphasizes a healthy, low sugar, low-carb diet, plenty of low impact exercise (swimming) and lots of rest. It is extremely difficult for diabetics with neuropathy to \"normalize\" & \"control\" without executing these basic & vital lifestyle fundamentals.  In my opinion, your best chance at alleviating pain from your condition is to \"execute\" your doctors instructions as best you can. That will lower your blood sugar levels and, in turn, reduce inflammation in your feet. It's difficult, yes, but it's a challenge all diabetics face, daily. There's great hope but only for those that eat and live with the focus on reducing inflammation.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

{"threadId": "Numbness", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Dear Lissa, I did have conversations with that person since over 20 years Type 2. He confirmed about initially similar symptoms at his feet\u2019s as you have on your hands. Sometimes similar symptoms can have different causes, I therefore do not diagnose you and not telling you to have diabetes typical neuropathies and any diagnoses I strictly let remain to your doctors you need to consult as soon as possible.  About 6 months ago I incidentally meet that person at a supermarket and got into some conversation where we found out to live nearby and both diabetic so we exchanged name cards and he told me to have neuropathies at his feet\u2019s and that\u2019s why he has some problems at walking. This weekend I was able to speak with him about his experiences.  Resulting the desired experience report as following:  He informed that for over 10 years he went to the same doctor in diabetology and followed all advices of the 3 monthly consultations without any problems. He initially got informed to have the A1C at less 7% and that he did. When he became older at a consultation the doctor informed him, that according latest ADA guidelines for older patients they can have a little more relaxed approach of A1C 8% and so that got decided and he thought that\u2019s good news and applied that.  He mentioned about 1 year later under the A1C 8%, he felt some feelings reduction from the toes to about the middle of his feet\u2019s and at next 3 months doctors consultation did inform his doctor about this and the doctor mentioned this is something not unusual at diabetics after many years and it possibly could also disappear and important is just to keep good blood sugar control and that\u2019s what he always did.  But it did not disappear and became only worse. Therefore at next 3 months doctor consultation he mentioned that at nearly the complete feet\u2019s he has like numbness sometimes also with some pains more intense at night. The doctor mentioned neuropathic symptoms which about 80% of long-term diabetics more or less have as risks of diabetes and prescribed a pain-killer medication for if may needed.  At next 3 months doctors consultation he mentioned that his feet\u2019s partially also got reddish skin and numbness and pains increased and he asked for some therapy to eliminate this, where the doctor just replied, by which kind of therapy and additionally to the pain-killer prescribed an anti-inflammation drug. (At that moment he decided that something cannot been normal with his long-term doctor and changed to some younger doctor in diabetology. He in the meantime start walking like on pillows not really feeling when the feet\u2019s touching the ground.)  At first doctor\u2019s consultation with the new one, he got some blood thinners medication for better circulation and a different anti-inflammation drug and pain-killers prescribed and the rest just made all the same as by the former doctor also decided with the same target A1C of about 8% as OK. (He felt the anti-inflammation drugs not so effective, because the reddish skin coloration of his feet\u2019s did not improve.) The new doctor because like to help, made also contact with a doctor in neurology since this has also with nerves to do.  He did have the consultation with the doctor in neurology and that one could also not provide anything to improve the conditions and decided together with his diabetes doctor to arrange that he could go to some rehabilitation center where they have more experiences with such cases.  He went to some rehabilitation center and there they decided additionally to the existing medication, to apply monthly Vitamin B12 injections with daily Vitamin B6 and offered the opportunity to join an international study for weekly Alpha Lipoic Acid injections for free which maybe offer some reverse effects and he accepted. At the rehabilitation center they decided the A1C of less 7%.  From that moment on during the past 2 years he has been in several rehabilitation centers and could not anymore say how many different doctors he did meet. All he could say, his neuropathy did not improve, but did also not getting worse by the received therapy, still walking at pillows like drunken, the feet\u2019s still with reddish coloration and need to take the pain-killers. He mentioned if he would have had the last therapy version from the beginning, maybe he would not been in this conditions and if he would not insisting so much, he would not even have that poor result.  He mentioned, he should never have that high A1C of 8% as by his doctors by ADA advised and finally at internet could find out, that when this started his A1C by the therapy should have been reduced to even less 5.5% same as for healthy people.  Resulting together with his doctor in diabetology he will now see what possible alternatives to do for any improvements.  End of experience report.

Leave it to cannabis to get a discussion board going. Here's my two cents: Use your good judgement by following your body \"signals\".  Marijuana is considered an anti-inflammatory. That's what its known for. That's why its widely used for medicinal purposes. At the same time, each person is different. Each person lives entirely unique lifestyles and are exposed to completely different environmental stimuli/conditions. In other words, asking this question to a board is.................\"stupid\".  So, test. You bought the stuff. You made up your mind, all ready. Just be smart. Try small amounts and see how it affects you. Check your blood pressure, before and after use. If it goes down, that's generally speaking, what you prefer to see. That's an anti-inflammatory response. Check your blood sugar, before and after use. If it goes down, that's generally speaking, what you prefer to see. That's an anti-inflammatory response.  I smoke weed on occasion. Relatively no change.

{"threadId": "Diabetes and Exercise", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Hi Joyk1,  I am an exercise physiologist and CDE and may have a few pointers for you! First, the pump is a great tool to adjust insulin before, during and after your workouts. But, because there are sooo many options it can get a bit overwhelming too. First, you may need to do a temporary basal rate a few hours prior to your workout. You may need to do a temp. basal rate during (or disconnect) and post workout too. And, if you are eating meals before or after your activity you may also need to adjust your bolus dose too! Ultimately, you are correct. If you are drinking or snacking a lot to offset a low blood sugar, it can negate the calories burned during your workout. It can be very frustrating!  As a VERY general guideline, you do not want your blood sugar lower than 110mg/dl after your workout (and if it is less than this during your workout it is obviously too low). Pre-workout, most of my patients find if they go above 200-220mg/dl they do not feel like they have a lot of energy and then we will have to start checking for ketones when your blood sugar is above 250mg/dl. Of course, always speak with your physician/endocrinologist regarding your insulin adjustments and prior to starting any moderate to intense physical activity program.  Keep up the great work and don't forget to check your blood sugars before, during and after your workouts while you are \"sorting\" out how to make your insulin adjustments.  Feel free to ask me more questions!  Best, CoachCDE<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

{"threadId": "At our wits end...", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Anon, Your post drew me out of my self-imposed forum posting retirement because I could \u201cfeel\u201d the pain, frustration and anguish you projected. The path that your daughter was on seemed to even threaten her ability to celebrate her 23rd birthday. By that, I don\u2019t mean to just live through that date but to actually celebrate and enjoy it; something that\u2019s possible only with good health. Here are some initial suggestions:  1. One of the first things that both you and she needs to do is to discard any guilt or self-blame in her situation and, instead, embrace a \u201cCAN DO THIS\u201d spirit. It isn\u2019t magic, it isn\u2019t even very difficult (challenging, yes, but not difficult). You only need to clear your mind, recognize that what she has been doing is clearly not working for her, and be willing to embark on a new path, a new direction.  2. If you/she aren\u2019t already doing so, start keeping a journal, log or diary of her dietary consumption, insulin dosages together with a detailed, running record of her blood sugar levels. Don\u2019t just write everything down. Go back and review and analyze the data on a daily basis. Try to see if you can spot any trends, correlations, and/or associations because therein lies your solutions. The use of a CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitor) would be of tremendous help but due to their expense, is not an absolute necessity. Many, many thousands of us have never used a CGM (including me); yet we are able to achieve near-normal (non-diabetic) blood sugars.  3. Learn all that you can, but at a pace that does not overwhelm your capacity to absorb and comprehend the information. Be absolutely certain that your education comes from reliable, proven sources based on positive results from the readers and not just testimonials that are merely promotional propaganda. Avoid books with glib promises such as those that claim their particular \u201csecrets\u201d will \u201creverse\u201d your diabetes. For example, far too many of the authors who advocate that merely adopting a plant-based diet will result in a miraculous improvement are guilty of this false promise. Here are my personal recommendations: Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution - Richard K. Bernstein Think Like A Pancreas - Gary Scheiner Blood Sugar 101, 2nd Edition - Jenny Ruhl  4. There are three groups of macronutrients: carbohydrates, fats and protein. Of the three, carbohydrates have the single greatest impact on blood sugars. Even the ADA and virtually all doctors and dietitians acknowledge this fact. Yet most continue to tell patients that they \u201cneed\u201d to consume carbs to function; that it is essential to eat at least 40 Gms per meal or more! That is an absolutely false statement and holds no truth whatsoever. You may already know this or have seen this in many of the postings on Type1Grit. Even young kids know that carbs and processed foods are damaging to T1s. Has any member of your daughter\u2019s healthcare team recommended a low-carb or paleo-based diet to your daughter?  If you haven\u2019t yet done so, be sure to watch this presentation by R. David Dikeman on the DietDoctor website:  https://www.dietdoctor.com/member/presentations/dikeman  Protein will also convert into glucose through a process known as gluconeogenesis but it is a slow process and most T2\u2019s can secrete sufficient insulin to keep pace. However, most T1\u2019s need to use insulin to offset the protein conversion and very often, a slower form of bolus insulin may work better (e.g., Regular-R). I personally only use the faster acting insulins (Humalog, Novolog, Apidra) to correct highs but my mainstay insulin is R (Humalin-R or Novolin-R). One significant word of caution: When reducing carb consumption or changing insulin types, it is essential to talk with her doctor. If he/she is not receptive but cannot provide an acceptable explanation, then you may need to seek guidance elsewhere. However, don\u2019t go on your own.  Comment: I personally DID start using insulin on my own but my mother was diabetic and taught me more about diabetes, dietary impacts, and insulin dosing than anything I ever learned in pharmacy school (I earned a doctorate in Pharmacy at USC). Although I started dosing with insulin on my own, I did do due diligence research before doing so. However, this is NOT something that would be safe nor recommended for most people.  5. Consider the wise advice of people at the Behavioral Diabetes Institute: maintain the best blood sugar control you can, avoid lows (hypoglycemia) especially severe lows, and live your life. Don\u2019t place any credibility on the constant claims that a cure for Type 1 diabetes is \u201cjust around the corner.\u201d Don\u2019t use your meter to shoot for perfection. Simply establish goals (target range for acceptable blood sugar levels) and then try to attain them. This should not be a static number but dynamic, subject to ongoing change and improvement. Don\u2019t beat yourself up if you fall short; just evaluate the data and try to do better next time.  6) TEST, TEST, TEST! Frequent blood glucose testing normally results in better control. Don\u2019t allow embarrassment to prevent you from testing or injecting in public if you are not using an insulin pump. Insulin dosing is essential to maintaining and preserving your health so just do it. You should try to be discreet when possible, of course, but at other times, you can use the privacy of your car or a nook or cranny in a building. I have even used a restroom occasionally but usually choose not to due to the unclean environment of most public restrooms.  7. Eat to your meter - use your blood glucose meter to test your blood sugar after meals. Journal everything and gradually eliminate from your diet those foods that spike your blood sugar. Follow \u201cthe rule of small numbers,\u201d Dr. Richard K. Bernstein\u2019s principle of \u201cbig inputs make big mistakes; small inputs make small mistakes.\u201d Simply put, lower carb intake means lower doses of insulin are required and smaller doses mean smaller \u201cmistakes\u201d (dosage errors) will be made. Do NOT try to consume large amounts of carbohydrates and then try to offset their effect by injecting large doses of insulin, regardless of what the A.D.A., diabetes \u201ceducator,\u201d or dietitian often keeps telling PWDs. Food and insulin both have activity curves that are different from one another. Trying to match the two action curves to prevent spikes and blood sugar hypos is virtually impossible. Roller coaster blood sugars do long term damage to the internal organs of any diabetic resulting in many complications. Avoid this disaster at all costs.  8. Re-evaluate the capabilities of your daughter\u2019s existing healthcare team. Based on your own post, there may be some serious shortcomings in the care and advice they are providing to her. It may very well not be a case of your daughter just being \u201cnon-compliant\u201d or \u201cmismanaging\u201d her diabetes but could suggest a change in one or more members of her health care team. Make your evaluation and analysis as objective as possible. Seek a second or outside opinion if necessary. However, the bottom line is that each of us is responsible for 90% to 95% of our diabetes management and we can\u2019t afford to pass the buck. One of the most challenging factors in controlling blood sugars is your daughter's gastroparesis. How advanced or serious is her gastro?  These suggestions are just a bare beginning but will provide you and your daughter with ample food for critical and objective thought. I\u2019m sure that some of them are redundant and that you are already following them. However, your daughter\u2019s declining results indicate that she may be frustrated, perhaps even depressed, and may no longer be evaluating her procedures objectively. In my youth, the hippies had a favorite saying: \u201cToday is the first day of the rest of your life.\u201d Then Dr. Albert Einstein was attributed with coming out with a series of quotes, two of which have been my personal favorites: \u201cYou never fail until you stop trying\u201d and \u201cInsanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\u201d  Side note to Brunosbud: glad to see a name that I recognize. I personally don\u2019t like the new message board format. There is no provision for embedding hyperlinks without posting the entire string for the link. There is also no means to post (embed) photos, charts, and graphs. The old WebMD forums did support these features and I miss the ability to be able to include charts and graphs.

{"threadId": "Diabetes", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Hello.  It is common practice for a doctor to order fasting blood work from a lab about every 3 month. A special test called an HBA1C is performed, among other tests. The HBA1C is a percentage of how much glucose is attached to your red blood cells, I believe. It is measured as a percentage. A person who does not have diabetes will get an HBA1C result of 4 - 6%. Higher than a 6% result shows that the person does have diabetes.  Every person who has been diagnosed with diabetes needs to test their blood glucose readings often using a home a glucose testing kit. The first test of the day is called a fasting test, and should be done after 10-12 hours with no food at all and some plain water. Then a test called \"post-prandial\" is done 2 hours after eating a meal. The goal is to get a fasting glucose reading at home of 70-100, and a post-prandial reading of less that 140 (some doctors and experts say up to 180 is OK).  So, the doctor should order a fasting blood test called an HBA1C to be performed at a lab about every 3 months. Home testing should be done as described above.  If the doctor does not encourage the testing routine I have described, then it is time to find a doctor that does. My late mother-in-law had a doctor for over 40 years who never had her do lab work but relied solely on what she told him were her readings at home. When he retired and my wife switched her to our primary doctor he ordered lab work and her HBA1C was 10.7. Dangerously high, and she had to start kidney dialysis shortly after that and did that for the last 2 years of her life.  The bottom line is that part of managing diabetes is to do all the testing I have explained in this post. Keep your doctor aware of your home glucose test results and consult him often for assistance.  I hope this helps you understand what is involved with glucose testing for diabetics and how important it all is.  Blessings, -Dave<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

It could be an infection... An allergy...a supplement or vitamin...a new script from your doctor...skin or hair care products...tooth decay...digestive issues...fat cells are releasing inflammatory chemicals in your body that are causing you to retain water. Stress causes havoc with your hormonal & immune systems. Alcohol and smoking are highly inflammatory. You could be suffering depression...leaky gut syndrome...and, of course, foods. If you're not cooking your own food, daily, then you're trusting somebody else's judgement on what is safe for you to consume. Be it restaurants or processed foods, ie. a \"label reader\". Walk into any grocery store and you will see hundreds of 'em. Ask yourself, \"How's that 'label reading' working, so far?\" If label reading is so effective, if there are restaurants on every street corner in the city you live, what does this say about the fact that Type 2 Diabetes and obesity is continuing to rise, nationwide?  The point is, if you have significant inflammation, ongoing, it works against whatever exercise (and other weight loss efforts) you do. What this means is, \"lifestyle matters\".  I can't comment on your particular situation because I don't have a clue what you're doing, what you're eating, how much stress you're under, how well you take care of your body, hell, your basic hygiene, even. All I can say is, I've been there done that. Weight loss is a very complex ordeal and requires great patience. You have to be highly diligent, disciplined and committed to your goals. Exercise is, without question, a critical and essential piece of the weight loss puzzle. And, of course, diet is even more important. But, the aging process makes fighting inflammation harder and harder. So, if you think that once you lose the weight you can relax and take your foot off the gas pedal, I've got bad news for ya...

Cancer...Diabetes...Heart Disease...COPD...Rheumatoid Arthritis...Fatty Liver...Depression...etc., etc.  You don't \"treat\" diabetes (or, any of the above). That's beyond anybody's pay grade. You \"prevent\" diabetes...by taking good care of your body.  The truth is, the majority of people in this country, A. Don't have the time to take better care of themselves B. Don't have the information or are willing to learn how to take better care of themselves C. and, they sure as hell don't have the patience and determination to rebuild their body from the ground up. It's infinitely easier to \"treat\" diabetes than prevent (or, reverse) diabetes. Your doctor doesn't demand you do anything (except take the drugs) or tell you MUST stop eating this or drinking that.  Modern medicine can't make demands. Doctors can only \"suggest\" or \"recommend\". That's why T2D & Obesity is epidemic. You can't reverse these conditions without making big changes to one's lifestyle.  Don't get confused with terms. \"Reversing\" diabetes essentially means taking better care of your body to the point that your blood glucose returns to normally regulated levels...and, your cholesterol levels normalize, too...and, you shed are the excess pounds...and, your blood pressure returns relatively close to 120/80...etc, etc, etc.  If you have Type 2 Diabetes (like I did) and you've been \"treating\", with drugs, for a long period of time, just ask yourself, honestly...\"Am I getting better or am I getting worse?\"  If we are being honest, here, the answer is an emphatic \"No\". Without improved lifestyle changes, your diabetes will \"progress\" (that's the medical term for \"you're floating up the creek without paddles\")  Rebuild your body and turn back the clock. That's the only way to HONESTLY \"treat\" diabetes. I did that 12 years ago and I haven't failed a glucose test, since. Tah-Tah<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

I just watched it, myself, and my overall assessment is, \"Spot On!\"  Here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk2fvu5nw87EyAiiSKCkosw  A member made the comment to me the other day... \"...It's really not fair to blame people for their disease...\" My only response to this is please watch this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9zzJSKXWqc   If you don't take full responsibility for your diabetes, if you don't adjust your lifestyle habits to boost your vitality, if you don't eat the fruit and vegetables (and, I mean fill your #$%*!'n plate!), if all you do is tell yourself, \"it aint fair to blame me for my disease!\" & \"Don't you DARE judge me!!!\"...  ...then, you cannot reverse your Type 2 Diabetes.  \"Dad\" didn't know this. Any of it. And, it took his loving sons to beg him to change his life, that he had no right to deprive his grand kids from being a vital part of their lives, it took the imminent threat of having his foot amputated, before he took his first steps towards reversing his diabetes.  I only post this comment for those, out there, that feel the same way that \"Dad\" feels about his sons and his grand sons. That's the way I feel about mine, too. Because, we live in a world, now, that \"blame\" is not tolerated. \"Blame\" has become a four-letter word.  But, when it comes to Type 2 Diabetes, it will \"progress\" if you try to \"treat\" it. I learned this valuable lesson from my father who followed his diabetes doctors every word...and, in the end, still got taken to the woodshed by T2D!  The system of T2D \"treatment\" in the US, predicated on taking drugs, is, for lack of a better word, \"delusional\". \"Dad\" shows this so wonderfully. Because, It's hard to change... We shouldn't \"blame\" or \"judge\" one another and... If reversing T2D is within the grasp of millions of diabetics in this country, why the hell isn't this the Number 1 topic discussed on this board?  Dad: \"...I only wished I had that 'light bulb' moment, early on..........it  literally took me seeing a guy having his foot cut off, before I  realized, \"Whoa. This is serious!'...\"  Here's, my point. If you don't change your lifestyle and try to \"treat\" your diabetes (with drugs), in the end, you could be faced with the harsh and brutal realities of end stage diabetes. You have to change, NOW, and time's a wastin'. Start will small changes in diet, a few veggies and maybe some full fat, plain greek yogurt and add a little exercise to your daily routine.  Finally, understand this. Nobody will force you to do this. Nobody will make any demands that you save yourself (like Dad's sons). Nobody will tell you the sky will fall if you don't stop eating the things you love. Being perfectly honest, I could care less if you decide to reverse your Type 2 Diabetes like \"Dad\" (and I) did. It's a free country; Do whatever you like as long as it doesn't affect my life in the least. And, you eating fruit & vegetables, daily, will still cost me a $1 at the local McDonalds...  But, if you want to really want to beat T2D, you have to take responsibility. The buck stops, here. You have to \"BLAME\" yourself!

This is true for many reasons, including the fact that there is so much misinformation out there and no one can really understand how hard it is without having diabetes themselves.  You can't simply take point in time blood glucose measures and draw any conclusions. You have to be able to look at a very large amount of data over a very long period of time to get a handle on what is going on.  Finally, if she had kidney issues (either contributed to by the diabetes or being caused by other things) this adds an entire other level of dangers. Too much of certain minerals could have affected her health and her heart significantly. Kidney issues also can adversely affect the diabetes. It becomes a very complex combination of diseases to deal with (I've been doing so since the 80s). As I've said, I'm very sorry for your loss.

They may have many of the symptoms of type 2 diabetes, but  actually have another condition that may be more closely related to  type 1 diabetes. This condition is called latent autoimmune diabetes  in adults (LADA).   Researchers estimate that between 4 and 14 percent of people  diagnosed with type 2 diabetes might actually have LADA. Many  physicians are still unfamiliar with the condition and will assume a  person has type 2 diabetes because of their age and symptoms.   In general, a misdiagnosis is possible because:   both LADA and type 2 diabetes typically develop in adults  the initial symptoms of LADA \u2014 such as excessive thirst, blurred  vision, and high blood sugar \u2014 mimic those of type 2 diabetes  doctors don\u2019t typically run tests for LADA when diagnosing diabetes  initially, the pancreas in people with LADA still produces some  insulin diet, exercise, and oral drugs usually used to treat type 2  diabetes work well in people with LADA at first  As of now, there is still a lot of uncertainty over how exactly to define  LADA and what causes it to develop. The exact cause of LADA isn\u2019t  yet known, but researchers have identified certain genes that may  play a role.   LADA may only be suspected after your doctor realizes that you\u2019re  not responding (or no longer responding) well to oral type 2 diabetes  treatments, diet, and exercise...\"  (pardon me, mrsc, but if this is NOT the \"spectrum\" you're referring to, please, provide some references that we can examine to understand your point. thx)   I've made this point on more than one occasion but the fact that Type 1 Diabetes and Type 2 Diabetes share the word \"Diabetes\" in its name is one of the biggest travesties in medical terminology, imho.  9 out 10 diabetics in this country are Type 2. When I speak of diabetes I refer almost exclusively to Type 2 Diabetes.  I am (was) Type 2. You are Type 1.  I can and did reverse my Type 2 Diabetes (aka \"Insulin Resistance\") through lifestyle changes. Reason being, I was able to improve my insulin sensitivity (through diet and fitness) so my body was eventually able to \"restore\" normal blood glucose regulation.  Type 1 Diabetics can't \"reverse\" their condition. Their blood sugar irregularity is not caused by insulin resistance (from too much insulin). Their problem is their pancreas makes insufficient or no insulin, at all.  Bottomline, reversing Type 2 Diabetes refers to training your body to use less insulin. Type 1 Diabetes is caused by too little insulin. The conditions may share the same \"name\" but, from my perspective, they are as different as night and day.  Note: Many Type 2's eventually wind up injecting insulin, same as Type 1s. My dad spent the last 8 years of his life using insulin after treating his Type 2 for twenty years taking metformin. Was he LADA? Some will speculate, \"YES\"...  ...I, for one, aint one of them, though.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

Another cause of high blood sugar is when the body is in a state of physical stress associated with critical illness like a stroke or heart attack.

Question 1. What for was your Sister 3x in the hospital? Question 2. How you know about her Glucose levels up-to 108 mg/dl but not knowing anything about Diabetes and her Kidney problems? (Before her death, she must have had this since years before.)  Question 3. You did write \u201c . . . in Jan. normal again at 101-105 but she was taken by ambulance on Feb. 16th, unresponsive and treated with heart jump start meds and shock.\u201d This creates the question, if the ambulance personals have been experienced enough for such situations. The ambulance personal by the standards should have also measured the Glucose (but did they ? or just later in the hospital) and at such low Glucose immediately should be applied Intravenous Glucose Injection and as very important also Intravenous Potassium Injection and connect with a Glucose \u2013 Potassium Infusion to transport to the hospital ! This about the Potassium at extreme Hypo of 30 mg/dl or below; only a well experienced Endocrinologist will know, that at extreme Hypo not only Glucose get lost, but the body to compensate will also quickly lose Potassium and if this does not also get quickly supplemented by Intravenous Injection, then the Heart as usually will stop by not enough Potassium as commonly known in the medicine. This creates the question, from at the moment of the ambulance and in the hospital, has a well experienced Endocrinologist joined the team for them to know what\u2019s necessary to do?  You mentioned Insulin Overdose and this is understandable, but if someone is not Diabetics and by the presented Glucose values a little above 100 and if this numbers are for fasting Glucose then it would mean the beginning of Pre-Diabetes and as such would never get close to any Insulin Prescription!

Your SIS 120 is good your DIA 80 could be a little lower if you reduce to your normal bodyweight of max. 150 lbs for your height. Your present A1C of 9% represents average Glucose of 212 mg/dl and that is too much to remain in good conditions and for the Kidney to safe it should never be higher than 180 mg/dl. Your former A1C of less 7% represents average Glucose of less 154 mg/dl which is much better if you like to live much longer in good conditions. If you reduce an additional 20 lbs your A1C becomes also better. You have a good morning fasting Glucose by about 90 mg/dl but your less 200 mg/dl is too high and this gives the idea about 2x daily Morning- and Lunge- time 50mg Glucobay to take for you to speak with your doctor about this.

So, what will work for you, diet-wise, at 42 may not be the case, when goofball gets to be my age, 62. Capisce?  Why not ask your doctor to recommend a registered diabetes dietician so you can learn some \"basics\" on meal planning (based on what you like to eat). (Example: You like liver? I do. But, maybe you don't. You like raw fish? I do. But, maybe you don't. A good diabetes diet is food you like to eat mixed with food you \"should\" eat. So, why ask diet questions from complete strangers..........goofball?)  And, if you're not exercising, regularly, ask your doctor for a referral on a qualified trainer. No point in over doing it and getting injured when you're just getting started.  Then, once you've got your feet wet and you feel a little better about how you can \"safely\" go about your day, then, you can come back here and learn a little more about fine tuning \"how many carbs\".   PS: How well do you sleep; Do you think you may have sleep apnea? How much water do you drink each day? How much exercise do you do each day. How well do you manage daily stress levels? Do you smoke (if so, STOP!)? Do you drink alcohol (if a lot, STOP!)?  I'm 62, m. I've reversed my Type 2 Diabetes for over 10 years without the use of diabetes meds. I stopped taking blood sugar readings three years ago. I am retired. I have taken a minimum 13,000 steps, everyday, for the last 12 years. I use to be an alcoholic (quit). I used to smoke two packs a day (quit)... I am presently drinking 100 ozs of water (not including coffee). I used to drink more but I've backed off, a bit...  and, I've never counted \"carbs\", ever (no one has ever gotten fat or T2D from eating tomatoes, avocados and apples). You may think it's rocket science at the moment but, in truth, it aint. My reasoning: The day Michael Phelps, Lionel Messi, Roger Federer, Tom Brady, Lebron James and Tiger Woods announce they have Type 2 Diabetes is the day I'll rethink my \"theory\" that if you improve your health and fitness, you lower (or reverse) your T2 Diabetes.

Not many medical professionals are teaching patients how to reverse their Type 2 Diabetes because there would be a loss of revenue for the drug companies as well as many doctors.  My wife and I both have Type 2 Diabetes. There is a strong genetic factor in both of our families, plus the past 5 or so years have been extremely stressful. Despite our best efforts, we are now insulin dependent. We have a Medicare Prescription plan with a high deductible for Tier 3 drugs. Insulins such as Levemir, Humalin, Novlog, etc. are Tier 3 drugs in this plan. When we met with their rep in October of last year, we did not pay attention to the high deductible because neither of us were in need of a Tier 3 drug. When we went to have our first fill of Levemir pens, we each paid over $400.00. Going forward until the beginning of next year the refills will be $31.00. Fortunately, our excellent primary doctor was able to prescribe a good amount of pens that should last us several months every time we refill the prescription. Just an example of how getting treatment for Type 2 Diabetes can be quite expensive. Certainly we are still making efforts to be able to reduce or stop the insulin, but for now it is a need.

I could learn how to do injections pain free.  ADA has so much money and because of that cannot do any better.

The ADA never financed FDA 3 Phases Clinical Trial Costs of $ 50-100 Million.)  From your descriptions I do some assumptions and proposals. I\u2019m a PA. The Levemir is not really a 24 hours Basal-Insulin as the Toujeo by the diagrams and for Type 2 it should be a real Basal-Insulin in combination with Metformin. The Levemir to reduce the risks of Hypos to get so-so right need possibly to be injected 3x daily, but the Toujeo by normal doses up-to 50 Units just once daily and higher doses every 12 hours 2x daily with a perfect horizontal efficiency line and No Hypo risks. Toujeo you can get only in Pens for safety, but no refills. You should speak with your doctor about this. You and your wife have the genetic preconditions for Type 2 as you mentioned and by this have a Too Good Digestion making it nearly impossible to reach the normal bodyweight essential to reverse it. This means you and your wife would have the preconditions for by bariatric surgery shortening the intestine to adjust it to the normal digestion and by this within 2-3 years get the normal bodyweights with as positive side effect maybe no need for medications or very reduced.

Just some information from the Metformin medication\u2019s professional info. Normal Metformin when taking it takes 2.5 hours to reach the Tmax and within the following 3 hours only 50% of the dose remains in the blood and after 9 hours about 10% only.

Additionally the SR or XR version does not show any digestion problems, where the normal Metformin often does and peoples stop taking it and say could not accepting it anymore.

On the other hand, if you believe in the model that Type 2 Diabetes is a very complex disease that involve multiple factors that can raise blood sugar levels that have little (or nothing) to do with food or sugar, that one the most important functions of the human liver is to \"bleed' sugar into the blood circulation, little by little, to avoid any possibility of going too low in glucose to the point that the brain becomes starved and, as a result, the body collapses into coma (not good). The role the liver and brain play in regulating sugar levels is crucial because a half million years ago, it was not so unusual to go \"days\" without eating food (no 7-11's & am/pm's, grocery stores or Mcdoogies, then).

But, consider the following: \"...About 1 man in 7 will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime. Prostate cancer develops mainly in older men. About 6 cases in 10 are diagnosed in men aged 65 or older, and it is rare before age 40. The average age at the time of diagnosis is about 66...\" http://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostatecancer/detailedguide/prostate-cancer-key-statistics  But, does the American Medical Association ever reveal that, based on autopsies of men in their 20's, it's shown that about 10% already show tiny signs of developing prostate cancer? No. They don't!  There's no money in getting people to \"prevent\" disease. There's big bucks, though, in \"treating\" people with \"life-threatening\" (aka, rock-n-hard place) diseases. This \"sheep & shepherd\" mentality that people have with healthcare is the worst conspiracy propagated in America, imo. Say, \"Baaaaaaaaaaaaaa\", everyone.    What's the point? Why is it important to view Type 2 Diabetes as a \"spectrum\" disease, you ask?  1. To get young people to start thinking different than their \"ignorant\" parents and think of healthcare in terms of PREVENTION, not TREATMENT!!!!  2. To get young people to start thinking different than their \"ignorant\" parents and think of healthcare in terms of PREVENTION, not TREATMENT!!!!, and, most importantly,...  3. To get young people to start thinking different than their \"ignorant\" parents and think of healthcare in terms of PREVENTION, not TREATMENT!!!!

{"threadId": "Diabetic since 1994", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                Hi Thecynic \u2013 You\u2019re right there are also a lot of contradict studies out there and this especially when some doctors to show up create some new interpretation of existing studies, but call that also a study as we lately could see by some Dr. Lady at Joslin Diabetes Center which is trying to convince the medical industry that A1C of 8% compare to less 7% shows some reduction in heart complications and therefore the therapies should been individualized. The diabetics by individualized do understand to get more for the money, where in reality just get less. In the diabetes industry the money is not made by the medications, but by the many additional disorders possible and like that by the Crookies get strategically supported, as also by such as the ADA in its constant conflicts of interests where it get the donations and the sponsors money from of annually over $ 24 Millions to know well. The above mentioned Dr. Lady study mentioned that the hardliner to handle the diabetes at lower A1C do apply a more strict nutrition diet with less carbon hydrates. That the more strict nutrition Diet does also provide less Vitamins and Essential Minerals as for example the Potassium important for heartbeat, without it there is no beat possible, about this so important the Dr. Lady is not mentioning anything, funny! Until today there is not any study existing where the Potassium independent of the kind of applied Diet or A1Cs is kept stabile at about 4.4 mmol/l to avoid or compare heart complications. As by myself I could experience, one day I did have my SIS pressure up-to 150-160 I went to emergency and my doctors worried, but at the time as I could find-out the Potassium was only at about the minimum of the normal and so I applied the Potassium supplementing as at Google \u201cTwitter WDHCO\u201d topic 17. and within about 3 months my Heart conditions normalized back to the very good levels as it has been all my life and my Basal-Insulin dose also got only halve by the same fasting Glucose setting at 80-90 mg/dl.  About this above can now everybody form its own conclusions!  Thecynic \u2013 Here I like to provide you something you can do by yourself at weekly base by your hands and eyes like the old doctors did. Its known that all additional possible diseases are mainly caused by the micro-macro-vascular disorders as well by all details described and even by some electron-microscopy picture shown or nih.gov links at WDHCO topic 1., to know that the capillary veins have a diameter of 1/100 of a millimeter only by its need to let pass red-blood bodies with a diameter of 6-8/1000 of a millimeter, which by none of any Sonography or MRI can been seen because too small to see and where only the possible complications as result can been seen. This where the red-blood bodies need to supply the body-cells with oxygen and the blood with nutrients for the body-cells able to live, not die and to exist in good conditions. We have to imagine that all the blood from the heart need to pass the capillary netting spread across the body parts and organs, before the blood can go back to the heart for the cycle to start all over again.  Here how to find-out about the sneaky micro-macro-vascular disorders by some simple method from the time the doctors did touch patients: 1. With the hands feel the temperatures of the legs calf and compare to the feet, where there should be no temperature difference or nearly none if everything is OK! (Feet colder means attention.) 2. With the eyes checking if some veins at the feet can been seen if the feet are not swollen and checking if the skin did not partially turn reddish (any inflammations caused by micro-macro-vascular?) to be OK! 3. With a ball-pen at the foot-solen and toes-underside, gently touching to create a tickling-feeling and if everywhere it is possible to have the tickling, it means everything is OK without any neuropathies caused by micro-macro-vascular disorders! If cannot get the tickeling-feeling and just the ball-pen pressure can be realized or partially not even that, then it means it\u2019s not OK. 4. If there are some problems on the feet, we can assume to have also problems somewhere else in the body.  I hope this is helpfully for you.

{"threadId": "What Do You Do To \"Fight\" Diabetes?", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Healthy is a word you'll commonly hear on health boards & everyone thinks (&, says) they live \"healthy\". But, what are common signs that suggest otherwise?  1. Bad Breath: The smell (or stink) of your breath has a direct correlation with your health because it relates to certain bacterial flora that thrive in your mouth and g.i. tract. Diabetics have a very distinct and unpleasant smell and people with diabetes will often chew gum, frequently brush or use \"breath\" mints to mask foul odors. This is a classic example, btw, of how modern medicine (drugs, quick fixes, \"health aids\") focuses on treating \"symptoms\". Instead of addressing the root cause (diabetes, poor diet, lack of exercise), we choose to \"mask\" stink-breath with antiseptics, toothpastes, tic-tacs and gum.  2. Bad Teeth: Teeth problems start in the gums in the form of gingivitis. Gingivitis (gum disease) is reflective of poor health (developing cardiovascular issues, diabetes, hypertension, poor diet, lack of exercise, SODAS / JUICE). Fact: The average adult between age 20 and 64 has three or more decayed or missing teeth! (Of course you know; this is a diabetes board, ain't it?) Haven't you noticed, when listening to the radio, how many dental ads played each hour? That's because dentists prefer to advertise on radio. And, as diabetes has exploded in numbers across America, proportionately so, has rotted and missing teeth. As long as people continue to eat faux food, get fat and refuse to regularly exercise, business will continue to thrive for the dental industry. btw, one of the best ways to teach your children how to be financially successful and have fewer money issues in life? All parents insist that graduating college is key. I have a better one:  Eat more fruits and vegetables.  btw, Do you ever wonder why the price of dental implants hasn't come down like, say, the cost of hearing aids and prescription eyeglasses? It's because, dentists and dental labs are smart. They know, precisely, where their bread is buttered (implants, crowns, dentures) and they will \"guard\" their livelihood (and the MBZs) with vim and vigor!  Bottomline: Truly \"healthy\" people don't pay mega bucks to dentists for implants, crowns and repeat dentures (because their anchors keep failing). When someone tells you they live \"healthy\", just look at their teeth. Do they smile, often? Or, are their teeth yellowed, chipped & crumbling? Are their gums any color other than bright pink? Please. Don't go around telling people how \"healthy\" you are if your teeth are clearly indicating, opposite.  3. Eyes and Vision Fail: Good health is reflective of bright, clear eyes. Conversely, if the eye whites are not bright white, that's reflective of faltering/failing health. Diabetes knows how to punish people for their procrastination and denial...it goes after the eyes. The eyes are the \"windows\". The eyes tell all you need to know about an individual's health. &, the eyes tell you whether you're winning of losing the war against diabetes. Same as dentists, business for ophthalmologists \"is-a-boomin'!\" If you don't eat right and you don't exercise, diabetes will slowly but surely ruin your eyes. All the meds, all the doctor visits, all the gimmicks and health aids, all the exercise equipment...this is why diabetes is 1/4 of a $TRILLION business! If your vision is worsening, well, guess what? You're treating \"symptoms\" and not attacking the root cause of Type 2 Diabetes, my friend. You want your \"cake and eat it, too\"? Nope. Uh-Uh. That's not how Type 2 Diabetes works. That's the beauty of diabetes: You can lie to everyone, else, but you can't lie to the bathroom mirror. If you want to save your sight (or keep what little you have remaining), meds will not save your eyeballs, sorry. You have to change your lifestyle.   There are many indicators of health. Weight is an obvious one. Weight can either increase, decrease of stay the same. Two out of the three are BAD (and unhealthy) and a sure sign of failing health. To be in good health means the body is static and stable...it's at \"peace\". Everything is working, efficiently and reliably. If you are overweight or obese, you still only have one heart, one liver, two kidneys, one G.I. tract and they are meant to maintain/operate ONE body, not one and one-half or two! Pimples and skin blemishes are another reliable indicator of a taxed/overworked immune system. Older adults with poor glucose control often look like they're going through puberty. Finally, frequent colds. If you get sick more than one or two times a year, you are not \"healthy\". You can say you are but you're in denial. And, just because you work closely with kids does not justify being sick more. Teachers are some of the most unhealthy people I've known, precisely, because they delude themselves into thinking, \"...Oh, it's normal to feel lousy multiple times a year because of my occupation...\" FAIL! It's not normal and, if you improved your health, you realize, lickity-split, there's nothing \"normal\" about getting sick, often, at all. Joint pain is a seldom discussed problem on this board but it's one of the biggest challenges of any diabetic in starting and maintaining a regular exercise program. How do you exercise when your body screams \"DON'T!\" It's a huge challenge to overcome.  I mention these key \"signs\" because anyone who has overcome Type 2 Diabetes and reversed their \"disease\", without meds, will, all, tell the same exact story. It doesn't take a \"specialist\" or A1C test to know where you stand with your T2 diabetes. Your body speaks to you, every freakin day. Your body is the best doctor in the world...

My father voluntarily ended his life by ceasing to inject insulin. With no insulin, cells can't absorb blood sugar. A few days later, organs begin to systematically shut down.  I discussed this process, at length, with my father before he made his \"decision\". He had Type 2 Diabetes and Parkinson's. With the help of my mother, he managed both conditions, beautifully, for over 25 years and died at the age of 87. But, in the end, he felt too much of a burden to my mother. He asked me to promise to take care of her once he was gone. Once I agreed to his plan, he stopped all food and water the following week. I immediately called in home hospice care, once the process began...  2 weeks later, he passed.    People who choose to die, I believe, actually, want to live.

To know how much or how little you can eat, you need to test after meals and see how the known amount of food affected you (like that 35 g of carb you mentioned).

{"threadId": "Rising blood sugar", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Another name for your liver is the \"Glucose Warehouse\". Did you know your liver can make glucose from scratch and dump it directly into your blood stream?  So, why would it (your liver) do such a cockamamie thing? Why would it try to sabotage your conscientious efforts to keep you blood sugar at safe levels?   1. You might have a cold or the flu. When you\u2019re sick, your body releases hormones and these hormones can interfere with insulin\u2019s ability to lower your blood sugar.  2. If you\u2019re under stress and not sleeping well, your body releases stress hormones, which again lower your ability to make insulin and process blood sugar.  3. You ate more carbohydrates the day before than you normally do.  4. You exercised less during the day than you normally do. When you exercise, your muscles take up glucose (sugar) much faster, resulting in lower blood sugar.  5. You could have what\u2019s known as the \u201cdawn phenomenon.\u201d Experienced by everyone, even those who don\u2019t have diabetes, the dawn phenomenon is part of your body\u2019s natural biological rhythms. Pre-dawn, usually between 4 a.m. and 8 a.m., your pancreas releases a surge of hormones, including glucagon and cortisol, and temporarily slows down insulin secretion. In response, your liver releases more glucose into your bloodstream. When you have diabetes, your body doesn\u2019t release enough insulin to adjust properly to this early morning surge of glucose, so you wake up with high blood sugar.  6. You could be experiencing \"the Somogyi effect\" and rebound hyperglycemia. This usually happens early in the morning. If you\u2019ve skipped your dinner or bedtime snack, or had a lighter dinner without adjusting your insulin doses, your blood glucose levels can drop after you\u2019ve been sleeping awhile. If this happens, your liver tries to return them to normal and releases glucose into the blood. Your liver can overcompensate for low blood sugar and cause it to become too high.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  That's just the tip of the iceberg, too. Do you see just how complex the regulation of blood sugar is in the human body?  Eventually, I did. I realized, trying to \"control\" blood sugar levels is like trying to solve a rubik's cube, blindfolded. In other words, its way beyond anybody's pay grade, especially, my Harvard graduated physician. So, what I did, instead, was lose all my belly fat (which cured my high blood pressure and sleep apnea, too). And, I eventually sold my business, too, and started playing golf twice a week.  And, lo and behold, my A1C dropped like a sonaofa...gun. Type 2 Diabetes happens in people in degrading health and is exacerbated by changes in hormone levels bought on by \"men & mano pause\". ie \"change in life\" associated with aging.  Are these processes \"reversible\"?  Of course, they are. Type 2 Diabetes is all about poor health and those who have little interest in doing much about it. You have to admit, it's a helluva lot easier to pop a pill and prick a finger.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

About minerals in the vegetables we have to mention that the quality is not anymore the same as 50 years ago, because by the atmospheric pollutions with sour-acid-rains the soil got washed-out by the minerals became deeper in the soil and as result the vegetables-roots cannot anymore reach as much minerals as it used to be and therefore we need to supplement certain minerals. The minerals have also some taste and as a good example we can realize how the tomatoes do not taste the same as used to be.  Mangan-Gluconat daily 5mg. Gluconat is sugar and to simulate the natural it\u2019s good to have some minerals by a sugar-compound to be bio-active. Mangan is useful for the body\u2019s cartilage at joints to repair and to reduce age related hearing losses. The Mangan is also harmonizing, supporting the Glucose Metabolism.

For example, everyone wouldn't mind eating cheese kept in a fridge for more than a month. But, how do you feel about drinking month old milk (organic vs non-organic?).  And, the article, above, shows that different insulins have different shelf lives, therefore, making this question even more difficult to answer since the poster doesn't specify which kind of insulin they're taking.  There are two essential rules that must be observed when taking insulin:  1. Going \"high\" (hyperglycemia) is not good but it's a helluva lot safer than going \"low\" (hypoglycemia). A comatose diabetic is not a good state to be in (and, that's what can happen when hypoglycemic).  2. You need to test with great frequency so you can see for yourself if your body is responding to each injection in a normal and \"relatively\" predictable manner. In other words, just because a vial that is being used for the very first time does not rule out the possibility that it's contents has expired, already. It's possible. But, even \"if\" the likelihood of this happening is remote, the only way you're going to find this out is if you test. Insulin users must be disciplined and fastidious when using this stuff! You need to be aware of the \"effectiveness' of every injection you make and, if the insulin you're using is not providing the anticipated results you \"expect\" to see, does it matter what the hell date is written on the bottle?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

{"threadId": "Rising blood sugar", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                I will be posting a new thread on sleep apnea, soon.  So many, here, think that obesity is the main forerunner to Type 2 Diabetes. But, from my own personal experience, sleep apnea was the chicken before the egg. So many major health problems, I believe, share a similar root cause. The biggest one may well be sleep apnea.  Bottomline, the body repairs itself during sleep and you can't receive the therapeutic benefits of deep (rem) sleep if you're waking up every 2 hrs to pee (nocturia). When the body suffers from bad sleep, night after night, the immune system becomes seriously impaired. That opens the doors to all kinds of co-morbidities...IBS, diarrhea, tooth decay, allergies, colds and flu, gout, skin problems, urinary tract infections...you name it. This is why, an uncontrolled diabetic is commonly fighting multiple issues, all, at the same time...  and, they all think they're \"unrelated\". That is just bad luck. Trust me, ask any diabetes specialist, nobody can maintain good control of their blood sugars without a good nights rest. NOBODY!  The diabetes drugs give us the illusion (lower A1C) that we're doing \"better\". That's not always true. My dad seldom had an A1C over 7.0 but his T2D continued to progress, year after year. How did he know this was true? His dosing kept getting higher and higher.  I don't place stock in A1C, much, anymore. The bottomline for me: My \"Symptoms\". What's my body saying.  If you're dealing with kidney disease and Type 2 Diabetes, you're batting after the seventh inning no matter what your A1C is. You have to exercise. You have to eat as clean as you possibly can. And, you have to manage your stress (without caffeine & alcohol!!!). Because, if you don't do these things, you can't sleep, well.  and, if you can't sleep, well,...well, you better start praying. Body can't improve without solid, deep sleep. The road to better health (and, improved blood sugar \"control\" :)) begins and ends when you turn the lights off at night.

Now that I understand your history at bit better, here's a few thoughts... 1. You're a few years my elder, nevertheless, we share a common experience. I believe: You don't \"treat\" Type 2 Diabetes! You improve and restore the body's health and the body will do all the necessary \"treatment\". 2. Why did the other conditions I had on our \"laundry\" list of ailments seem to resolve themselves once I \"reversed\" my T2D (T2D, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, obesity, osteoarthritis, gastric reflux, sleep apnea, pollen allergies, sick multiple times every year)? Answer: Because they all share the same root cause: Chronic inflammation. All these \"conditions\" are related. Since they share the same root cause, they are simply different metabolic \"expressions\".  In other words, I'm a \"cynic\" just like you. This board is filled with what I call, blood glucose \"manipulators\"...experts on metformin, insulin and other insulin affecting drugs. They preach that the key to treating Type 2 Diabetes is to lower blood glucose to \"acceptable\", \"normal\" levels.  What I learned is \"that\" is what the medical profession \"want\" us to believe. That it is beyond our capacity to heal, ourselves. That hypertension, high cholesterol, autoimmune disease, arthritis, cancer, kidney disease are all different and unique conditions requiring the services of a different \"specialist\" and, in turn, we need to swallow 5, 8, 15 different drugs, daily!  I don't know if you believe, same as I do. To a point, I don't think it really matters. At this point in my 62 years, I am free of all medical supervision and I will never go back. I practice preventative medicine, now, and I am at total peace with that decision. But, with one difference from you, though. I am no longer a \"cynic\". I understand why physicians practice medicine in the manner they do, today. It's for a very simple reason.  Changing lifestyle is beyond most people's capacities. &, no one ever taught us how to do something as difficult as that.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

If it was so universally understood that weight gain is a \"clear and present danger\" of developing insulin resistance, do you think so many parents would be so tolerant and accepting when their kid can't walk a lousy mile in P.E. without practically collapsing from exhaustion?  This is what we have to show for 50 years of \"research\" in diabetes. How many parents of school aged kids can even spell, \"insulin resistance\"? Am I the only one who thinks, political correctness is far more important to people, today, then the health and safety of their own child?  This is what we have to show for 50 years and trillions in research: \"Don't let anyone tell you different, honey!

{"threadId": "read about the Keto Fast diet", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Fasting is a great way to learn how your body works and, particularly, how your body uses food for fuel. What the hell do you think gastric bypass surgery is? It's violent, forced, \"smash-mouth\" fasting. And, the only reason why 75% of these patients regain the weight (and, the Type 2 Diabetes and, the high blood pressure) is simply because they have zero interest in learning anything about how their body works.   120 years ago, the Father of modern Diabetes Medicine, Dr. Elliott P. Joslin, first began to introduce landmark studies on the treatment of diabetes. Please read,   https://www.joslin.org/about/elliot_p_joslin_md.html  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3062586/  Included in his research was his discoveries on glucose modulation with intermittent fasting (starvation, actually :) ). So, what these bozos of medicine, today, are trying to sell you is nothing new (accept for a few jazzy terms like \"Keto\", whoopty-doop!).  Point is this, the human body has been \"designed\" to go without food for long periods of time. Believe it or not, there were no Walmarts or Trader Joes a half million years ago. So, humans won't die if they go without nourishment for a few days, weeks, even.  Proselytizing, aside, one thing I want to convey about fasting. It's very important! Fasting can be safe. Fasting can be extremely beneficial. Hell, fasting can be gd revelation! But, only in the hands of the sensible, now, because of DRUGS.  Most drugmakers (metformin, insulin) assume people are sheep who absolutely believe they must eat three squares a day or they will die so, if you STOP EATING FOOD, it can become very dangerous (for you)!  So, unless you're one of the nuts that have been on \"Judge Judy\" or \"The People's Court\" to sue your own mother or father, please be sensible and let your doctor know what you are contemplating on doing. It's because you take drugs. And, because you take drugs, you better know what you're doing when you fast, otherwise,...  Just consult your doctor, first, (not eggheads on social media) so you don't kill yourself.  Note: I \"reversed\" my Type 2 Diabetes and lost 44 lbs with the help of eating \"windows\" and my 95 yo mother eats 1 & 1/2 meals a day and is on zero meds and, her reverse mortgage insurer is regretting the day they met her.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

But the truth is that explaining what you\u2019re going through as you live your daily life with diabetes can be difficult, if not impossible at times. Still, that shouldn\u2019t get you down. A recent survey shows that 1 in 8 Americans has type 2 diabetes. With that statistic in mind, here\u2019s what a handful of others just like you think about what they\u2019re going through, and what they long for others to know about it too.  \"Sometimes, no matter how hard we try to make all the right choices and maintain our health, the disease just wins anyway and gets the best of us, even on our best days. But not every day is bad, which makes the good days really sweet (no pun intended) and worth the fight.\" -ADNEV JO, LIVING WITH DIABETES  \"Even though we don\u2019t look sick, we are.\" -JOSE GUZMAN, LIVING WITH DIABETES  \"My life has become a terrifying place to be. I fall without warning, and can\u2019t get up without assistance. I didn\u2019t take care of myself when I had the chance, and now I may never have the full use of my feet. I danced for 16 years, from the age of 3 until I was 19 \u2014 Indian classical (Bharatanatyam), Bollywood, jazz, hip-hop, and it was amazing.

Hell, I look back now at where I am and where I was and think that it wasn\u2019t difficult. But the truth is that each step of the way feels difficult as we move forward into the unknown of our mission: the unknown knowledge, the unknown endurance, and the unknown strength that we possess inside ourselves waiting to come out. I have beat the smoking habit, I will beat diabetes, and I will arrive one day completely debt free. For this is my mission.\" -BILLY, LIVING WITH DIABETES AND BLOGGER OF SIMPLE LIVING OVER 50  \"It\u2019s not only about following orders, or fulfilling requirements. The emotional component of diabetes makes it way more complicated than that.\" -BEA SPARKS, LIVING WITH DIABETES AND BLOGGER AT THE TYPE 2 EXPERIENCE  So, to answer your question (\"What happens to a person who has type two diabetes if they stop taking their meds?\"), It depends on who you are, does it not? Are you ADNEV JO, JOSE GUZMAN, SONA SANGHVI, BILLY or, BEA SPARKS?  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The key quote that applies to you is \"Billy's\": \"...But the truth is that each step of the way feels difficult as we move forward into the unknown of our mission...\"  I can tell you what happened to me when I told my doctor, \"No. I don't plan on taking metformin for my Type 2 Diabetes.\" She gave me a choice. You need to do one of two things: A. You need to start taking diabetes drugs that I recommend, or, B. You need to lose weight (44 lbs) through diet, exercise and taking better care of yourself.  I chose, B. That was over 12 years ago. I have never had a A1C test, since that time, higher than 5.6 (its currently 5.1).  Type 2 Diabetes is not a mystery to me, anymore. Its not an unknown. Its not something to fear. That's because I studied the disease and removed the mystery. I learned about insulin resistance, how the aging process accelerates it, how diet and exercise can slow and even \"reverse\" Type 2 Diabetes. And, how my Type 2 Diabetes was fueled by stress and sleep apnea like gasoline to flame.  All the quotes, above, are by people who live in doubt. They don't know what's going to happen, next. Since, they don't understand how Type 2 Diabetes works, they have no way of determining whether they are getting better or getting worse. All they know is their \"sick\".  The only person who has a \"chance\" is \"Billy\". He's committed to asking questions and finding answers. He's determined to become \"educated\" about Type 2 Diabetes. And, the more you study and learn, the picture becomes clearer and clearer: \"You don't TREAT diabetes (especially with drugs)! You re-tool your body, get it back in tip-top shape, and blood glucose levels normalize, automatically.\"  So, to answer your question, it depends entirely on who you are. If you stop taking metformin on a wing and a prayer, I'd say you're a damn fool. But, if you're determined (like Billy and me) to remove the \"mystery & fear\" from the T2 Diabetes equation and \"work the problem\" just like any other problem, I'd say, \"Good for you! You're on the right track to never having to worry about this disease, again\".  There's only one person qualified in this world to answer your question.

I look forward, now, to ones you can share with members & guests that can help them find solutions with this most serious health condition. That way, all of us can benefit and feel better about ourselves and our families.  Here's an example and one that may be of help to you. Good luck.    One of the biggest problem areas affected by diabetes are your teeth and gums. If the dentist you're seeing has the latest technology in dental equipment, it can save you a lot of time, a lot of money and, most importantly, a lot of pain...  Here's some examples:  1. Digital x-ray: Dentists who do not have digital x-ray equipment are practicing in the dark ages. Digital x-rays use less radiation than film. They are easier to read and the ability to manipulate contrast makes diagnosis more accurate. This equipment is expensive.  2. Ultrasonic Cleaning: Ultrasonic instruments vibrate plaque and calculus off your teeth, even in areas below your gums. It is much more comfortable than old-fashioned hand scraping. They can remove heavy stains (like tobacco and coffee) from the tooth and even treat periodontal disease. There is no excuse for not having it.  3. CEREC: For many dentists, this is the information they don't want you to have. The CEREC system lets your dentist provide a ceramic crown, onlay or veneer in only one visit. Use of CEREC can conserve the tooth structure and permit the dentist to seal the tooth in one appointment. No gagging impressions. CEREC means fewer injections, less drilling and no annoying temporaries.  The big rub is cost. A CEREC system will cost around $120,000.  4. Diagnodent: This is a laser which the dentist shines on the tooth and it tells whether there is a cavity and how deep it is. What's more, the laser can even tell your dentist that a root canal may be required. With the use of this technology, the dentist can detect cavities, and find them at an earlier stage, than traditional poking around the tooth (and no one likes that!).  5. TMJ (temporomandibular joint disorder): Did you know migraines and neck problems can be related to the position of your jaw? Your dentist should feel your joint and ask about any pain or discomfort you may be having.  6. Advancements in oral cancer screening allow your dentist to find it sooner. A Vizilite exam is a detection tool used by dentists to see tissue changes in their earliest form. The dentist has you rinse with a solution and then shines a specially designed light in your mouth which will indicate the presence of oral cancer.   https://www.aol.com/article/2009/08/27/secrets-your-dentist-doesnt-want-you-to-know/19134395/<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

I would think this is more for folks with Type 1 who need to test frequently during the day.  Over time you get use to the small sting the lancet causes when testing your glucose with a meter. Try going to the side of your finger rather than the pad. That seems to sting less.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

It can be reversed. The lemmings that take their pills, fret about \"blood glucose\" and complain about their doctors have wound up in the same boat for the last 60 years...sailing out to sea without a paddle.  The purpose and goal of intermittent fasting is the same as ketogenic diet: Its to deplete excess glycogen stores and, ultimately, rein-in an over-active liver that keeps dumping sugar into the bloodstream, even when there's no muscle activity (like when you're sleeping). Once the glycogen stores are minimized, the body can feed off body fat to generate energy. Thus, when performed properly, you've basically hardwired your body to metabolize food in a whole nother fashion.  That's the theory. You can do the same thing through starvation. Nobody has died during \"Naked and Afraid\" and nobody has Type 2 Diabetes once they return to civilization, either, because burning fat for energy is the holy grail of diabetes (and cancer, and arthritis, and heart disease, and high blood pressure, yada, yada...)  I had T2D a dozen years ago. I know I'm still insulin resistant despite never testing higher than 5.5, since.  I walk to keep my body in good muscle tone and regulate my blood sugar so that it never gets bat-s__t crazy. I've studied my body, learned how it reacts to different food and developed my own \"system\" to manage my T2D. I eat two squares a day: Breakfast (at 7:30) and a second meal (at 3:30). The key meal, without question, is breakfast. Since I perform my first workout of the day at 4am, every morning, by 7:30, my body is primed and ready to be nourished. I have simple basic rules. Avoid eating heavily processed food, don't eat out and watch the (added) sugar. I get an In-n-Out Dbl-Dbl w everything, once a month. So, if I get cancer or have a stroke from this system, I will have zero regrets.  \"...I am quitting this and going back to eating more regularly and see what happens...\" That's unfortunate. You already know what to expect with that \"system\". As Einstein said, doin the same thing but expecting different results, yada, yada.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

And, after 18 months, I reversed my Type 2 Diabetes for good.  That was 12 years ago. I've never took a single pill. I never tested higher than 5.5, since.  It's not rocket science. You \"experiment\" with your lifestyle and diet. And, you learn what causes the meter numbers to go up and go down.

{"threadId": "What Do You Do To \"Fight\" Diabetes?", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Part A: Worrying About Type 2 Diabetes  There's over a 1000 posts on this board with, somewhere, it reads, \"...I'm worried...\"  I understand why they feel that way...I've been in their shoes. Worry is bourne from not knowing what will happen, next. They're unaware of the \"odds\" of their condition. They see only bad outcomes, not the good, happy and, in my case, life-changing ones.  A lot of these posters are young. I'm old (61) & I've seen the \"consequences\" of poor choices and lack of (valid) information about type 2 diabetes. And, since Type 2 Diabetes, unquestionably, \"runs\" in families, there's high probability that these \"posters\" have seen it, too. In my immediate circle of family, I've had four people die of stroke/heart attack, 2 from heart & kidney disease and 2 have died from cancer (3 have survived cancer...for, now). Three of the, above, died before they saw the birth of their first grandkids. One \"survivor\" is attending college after Stage 4 testicular.  (Note: I know most of you are thinking: \"Well, what does this have to do with Type 2 Diabetes?\" Unfortunately, you don't know smack. They all share the same \"root cause\": chronic inflammation.)  That's the bane of growing old. You see lots of $h*t. But, here's a list of things I want to share with all these \"posters:  Don't worry. You have options. Just because you've been \"diagnosed\" with diabetes or prediabetes, it won't end badly if you take action...Now.  Part B: To follow, shortly...<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},
{"threadId": "What Do You Do To \"Fight\" Diabetes?", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                Part B: (continued)  \"Reversing Type 2 Diabetes\"  http://www.ncl.ac.uk/magres/research/diabetes/reversal/#overview \"....Our work has shown that type 2 diabetes is not inevitably progressive and life-long. We have demonstrated that in many people who have had type 2 diabetes for up to 10 years, major weight loss returns insulin secretion to normal. It has been possible to work out the basic mechanisms which lead to type 2 diabetes. Too much fat within liver and pancreas prevents normal insulin action and prevents normal insulin secretion. Both defects are reversible by substantial weight loss...\"  \"Can a Low-Calorie Diet Reverse Diabetes?\"  http://www.diabetesincontrol.com/can-a-low-calorie-diet-reverse-diabetes/ \"...What we have shown is that it is possible to reverse your diabetes, even if you have had the condition for a long time, up to around 10 years. If you have had the diagnosis for longer than that, then don\u2019t give up hope \u2013 major improvement in blood sugar control is possible...\" \"...the study supported the researchers\u2019 theory of a \u201cPersonal Fat Threshold\u201d: \u201cIf a person gains more weight than they personally can tolerate, then diabetes is triggered, but if they then lose that amount of weight, then they go back to normal. Individuals vary in how much weight they can carry without it seeming to affect their metabolism \u2013 don\u2019t forget that 70% of severely obese people do not have diabetes.\u201d...\"  Did you read the two articles, above? If so, what else are you \"worried\" about (your diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes)?  Here's the bottomline: 1. When you see your diabetes specialist and they explain the importance of diet and exercise in the treatment of this disease, don't ignore them! I find it ironic that everybody who posts, here, claims, \"I'm not overweight.\" Truth is 95% of all Type 2's are overweight or obese (that's 19 out of every 20 prediabetic/Type 2 Diabetic!). There is an overwhelming correlation between excess body fat and the development of T2 D! And, the point of these studies is clearly substantiating this premise: YOU LOSE SOME WEIGHT (5-10%), YOUR INSULIN RESISTANCE WILL DECREASE AND, EVENTUALLY, BLOOD SUGAR WILL NORMALIZE... In other words, any doctor that tells you the first line of defense in treating Type 2 Diabetes are drugs/insulin either, (1.) doesn't read, and or (2.) believes the \"old school\" notion that diabetes is a \"progressive\" disease and CANNOT BE REVERSED. And, you know what? If you take those prescribed drugs and ignore or marginalize the importance of weight loss, improved diet and daily exercise in treating this disease, your Type 2 Diabetes will, in fact, \"progress\" and deepen. How will you know this is has happened? Your drug(s) dosing will increase in order to reduce BS to acceptable levels.  The people who come here and say, \"I'm worried...\", they simply don't know that Type 2 Diabetes can be REVERSED. It is, in fact, not the least bit \"progressive\"! Lose some weight, eat right and exercise, then, call me liar. Go ahead, I dare you!  I've mentioned this many times in the past...I believe Type 2 Diabetes is a \"beautiful\" disease because it allows each one of us an opportunity to measure our self worth and see just how much we care for this blessed gift we've been given: Our life. No one (besides us) can repair broken blood glucose regulation, no amount of money can make this journey any easier and it plays a level playing field regardless of race, creed, color, young or old, man or woman. With Type 2 Diabetes, if you put in the work, you will reap the benefits. You don't make an effort to lose the weight, eat, smart, and you will pay for your carelessness. Is it possible, that I'm the only one who sees the fairness and utter simplicity of this \"test\"? So, what is your life worth?  Still \"worried\" about Type 2 Diabetes? That's cool. That's nobody's business but yours, alone. Bon, appetit.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

But, like everyone, here, you're focused on blood glucose and A1C.  Sure, you do not want high blood sugar. Sure, high blood sugar is bad. But, high blood sugar is a reaction from a body in a deteriorating state. aka, High blood sugar is a \"symptom\", not a root cause!  Your understanding as to why your blood sugar is high is off. And, you can't defeat an enemy if you don't know who the hell you're fighting.  The good thing is, there are many weapons, besides intermittent fasting at your disposal that can help you win the war...  Healthy green diet Good hydration Daily exercise Plenty of rest Sensible stress management Controlling alcohol, no smoking, supervised drug use  All of these things are discussed in the video! All of these things rehabilitate not just the liver, but the entire body. Muscles are your bodyguard at every stage of your existence.  My sister and my neighbor both had stage 4 cancer (brain cancer & soft tissue sarcoma). These are both aggressive and avg survival rates for both are less than a couple years. There both elected to \"treat\" their cancers through lifestyle change. It's approaching 4 years, now. They still are doubtful about their \"remissions\". Whenever we visit, I always ask, \"At what point will you \"trust\" that your body is stronger, now, and it's \"re-established\" the way to fight cancer cells?\"....&, \"When do you think you can take a breath and acknowledge you're 'winning'?...\"  They both smile and say, \"knock on wood...\" or \"let's see after my next checkup...\"    Bottomline, there are thousands of people that have \"reversed\" their Type 2 Diabetes, as I have. And, there are plenty that enjoy a night of \"dinner and have drinks\" on occasion, too.  T2D is a health issue, plain and simple. The problem is, as we age our body is changing and it becomes less and less tolerable to indiscriminate and thoughtless living.  That's why everybody, here, is so confused. They just can't wrap their heads around the fact that their 25 year old body is nothing like the 50 year old body they have, now...  not after all those \"dinners out and drinks...\"<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},
{"threadId": "High AM BG after fasting", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                When I made the decision to address my T2D, once and for all, it was a watershed moment. I needed to simplify my life. I needed to make room in my lifestyle to make new priorities and leave old ones, behind. I decided that I had enough \"stuff\" and killing myself for more useless, inconsequential crap wasn't going to make me happier...nor, healthier. But, most of all, my kids had my genes and if I didn't figure a way to resolve my health issues then they would have to fend for their own, later on. All my father's siblings got raked over the coals by T2D. Despite following every single instruction, from every single specialist, T2D got my dad, in the end, too. My dad had great doctors, all caring and conscientious professionals, but they just couldn't stop his glucose readings from steadily creeping higher and higher.    The \"tip\" that I learned from my personal odyssey, the message that I've shared with my two kids (and they will pass to their kids, god willing) is simple and direct...  \"Simplify\". Because, stress, kills.  You can exercise for hours, daily, and eat completely green, if you don't listen to your body when it tells you to stop, you're going to pay for your stupidity. Why do you suppose weed has become an absolute \"essential\" in countless households across America? It's no less important than milk and eggs, now. lol  It's simple. People can't stop shopping Amazon. They must \"flip\" a bunch of homes before they retire. They have to see both Northern Lights & Southern Lights and walk the Great Wall. They have to play Augusta National and TPC Sawgrass. Our heroes are Steve Jobs and Elon Musk. That was my life and I loved it...even, when I was spitting up blood! hahaha  The irony of my \"tip\" (simplify) illustrates the beauty and elegance of diabetes, imho. It's so simple and easy...yet, not a soul on this board can use it! What a shame. lol<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},
{"threadId": "fasting", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                \"...Only fast when instructed...\"  Sure. That's reasonable advice. Because, you take meds that, artificially, manipulate blood sugar levels. If you were to take meds that lower blood sugar, then, stop eating, you could potentially fall too low, aka, Hypoglycemia.   But, if you were to pay thousands $$$ to attend a \"Type 2 Reversal Clinic\", they wean you off the meds and have you lower your blood glucose, naturally, the way your body was designed to function... You stop eating \"faux\" food (sugar, white carbs) and sugary drinks. You drink water, only. You get plenty of rest & toss all alarm clocks in the trash. You exercise, daily. &, the kitchen closes at 6PM, every night, and doesn't open until 6AM the following morning.  That's what they make you do for paying them thousands of dollars...You \"fast\" for a minimum of 12 hours, everyday, for the rest of your life.  Diabetes is insulin \"resistance\". So, the only way to reduce insulin resistance is to use LESS insulin (not MORE). This is why short term fasting fights Type 2 Diabetes. And, this is also why people who take Type 2 Diabetes meds don't get better. They get worse. The more insulin produced, the hungrier they get, and because they are constantly eating, the more insulin their body is forced to produce. Round and around and around. This is why 9 out 10 people with Type 2 are overweight or obese.  This is what they teach you for thousands of bucks in a diabetes reversal clinic.  Eat real food, & Close the kitchen (fast)<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

My mom is 95. She takes no meds. She has no joint pain, walks in balance & stability, vitals are, all, normal. Though she no longer maintains a regular, daily exercise program, she has maintained a weight of 105 lbs, +/- 3 to 4 lbs, for the last 20 years.  She, too, eats a \"healthy\" diet.  My point is: A true \"healthy\" diet builds a foundation for stability. The human body seeks to maintain homeostasis. It does not want to gain weight. It does not wish for rising blood pressure or blood sugar or dislipidemia. Its does not want to develop malignant tumors or auto-immune conditions like hashimoto's thyroiditis or rheumatoid arthritis or pernicious anemia...  If vitals are changing, this means the body is NOT in a balanced state...it's, actually, in turmoil! It suggests that \"inflammation\" is taking place in multiple areas of the body. This is not \"healthy\". This is, in fact, \"unhealthy\". That's about as common sense simple as I can put it.   My recommendation to any person suffering from any lifestyle disease, before you start dosing (or, shall I say, \"dousing\") your body with prescription drugs (that really have no natural business being in your body from the get-go), you need to establish a baseline, daily lifestyle process that yields some semblance of stability and consistency. Exercise, diet, water consumption, sleep, relaxation are, all, necessary factors for stable health and fitness.  And, the very first place you start is with diet! A healthy diet does not make things worse! You do not gain weight & become obese by eating a healthy diet. Nobody in the history of history has gotten big eating apples, spinach, sweet potato or green onions on a routine basis.  In truth, a healthy diet can not only provide homeostasis & balance, but, in my case, it help me to \"reverse\" my obesity and Type 2 Diabetes. I've not A1c tested higher than 5.5 in the last 12 years by eating a \"healthy\" diet.   This is a perfect example of how the medical community \"treats\" diseases like T2 diabetes: Take the patient's word about leading a \"healthy\" lifestyle, then, throw drugs (and, $$$) at the problem. This is the extent of our exploration and investigation into root cause analysis of T2D.  Intelligent and highly educated adults, here, never ask the questions,  1. Why does T2D tend to develop after age 40?, and 2. Why do blood sugar, triglycerides, blood pressure, HDL, all, seem to magically \"normalize\" with weight loss?  My body \"treated\" my T2 diabetes (just as it had the first 50 years of my life!). The only thing I did was be far more diligent and discriminating in the \"stuff\" I put in it. Now, that I've experienced Type 2 Diabetes Reversal, I realize that as long as I eat a \"healthy\" diet, my body will do all the heavy lifting, required.  Think, if \"treatment\" of T2D by drugs was viable and effective, wouldn't that be the most important, the most ground-breaking medical discovery since penicillin.  If treatment of T2D was reality, don't you think Youtube & Google would share this with us, by, now?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

{"threadId": "What Do You Do To \"Fight\" Diabetes?", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    A visitor asked about eating too much \"brown rice\". This was my response...   I will try to explain why blood sugar rises in T2 Diabetics. Hopefully, by the end of this discussion, you'll refrain from asking \"what should I eat\" questions, forever.  First, please read the following, \"Diabetes and Inflammation\"  http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-2-diabetes-guide/inflammation-and-diabetes#1 (I care not whether you believe what I say but once you read it, you will realize, I'm not pulling this stuff out of my *** and making it up as I go...)  So, now that you know there is a relationship between high blood sugar and the body's inflammatory response (agro immune system>>white blood cells sent>>release of \"cytokines\">>> yada, yada, yada...), there you go! Chemicals released from bloody fat cells causes inflammation>>>>blood sugar soars. Who knew?!?! So, brown rice causes inflammation (indirectly)! Hot-diggety-dog! Problem solved! I'm a genius!...  But, hold on...Not so fast.  There are many \"things\" that can illicit an inflammatory response besides pancakes, french fries, spaghetti, snickerdoodles and BROWN RICE (no matter how much you EAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!).  Again, INFLAMMATION: occurs when chemicals from the body's white blood cells are released into the blood or affected tissues. It's designed to \"protect your body\" from \"foreign substances\" (ie. crap released from fat cells). These chemicals (cytokines) increase the blood flow to the area of injury or infection, and may result in redness and warmth. So, in other words, it's not a good idea to have a bunch of fat cells because it can cause \"inflammation\" and, as a result, raise my blood sugar. BOO-HOO.  OK, so being fat is not good. So, I'll lose some weight. That's why my doctor keeps badgering me. Now, it makes sense...  Just one problem: To reiterate, there are many things (hundreds!!!!!!!!) that can/may cause short term or chronic inflammation. Here's a 1 minute sampling...  bee stings yelling at your spouse or child (You spouse yelling at you, You yelling at the driver in front of you, You flipping the driver as you drive by,...) bruising your shin on the coffee table medications your doctor prescribed to you (birth control, decongestants, vitamin B, steroids, barbiturates, etc, etc, etc) any drug you heard from a friend of a friend that lost 30 lbs in 30 days! arthritis IBS High cholesterol High blood pressure auto-immune diseases menstrual cramps tooth aches colds and flus pollen peanut butter household cleaning products cosmetics ridiculous, untested \"supplements\" you saw on Dr. _z or Dr. Ph_l or Dr. Who tooth aches menopause poison oak flu shots antibiotics blood pressure meds cholesterol meds and, of course, \"brown rice\"  So, how in the world, would anybody (& their grandmother) know the cause of YOUR \"inflammation\" that resulted in your A1C going up? Sure, it could be all that brown sugar you ate. But, it could also be 10,000 other things!!!!! And, because you \"shared\" so much detailed medical information about yourself and family history, we have all the data needed to reach a definite, lock down, air tight conclusion...Yup. Has to be the \"brown rice\"!    I don't mean to make light of your question...  The truth is: Each individual has a unique, one-of-a-kind, metabolic make-up and what is likely the cause of their uncontrolled blood sugar regulation is not one factor (brown rice) but the combination & strength of HUNDREDS of FACTORS (age, diet, weight, race, family history, environmental conditions, stress, co-morbidities, medications, social network, etc, etc). But, because you don't understand how complex Type 2 Diabetes is (much less how inflammation affects blood sugar) the only thing you \"fear\" is food...  ...like, brown rice. So, fear it, if you must.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},
{"threadId": "The new Inhaled Mealtime Insulin Afrezza", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                Interesting comment about tumors in the lungs. I know a few that were in the fda clinical trials, that have been using Afrezza for over 10 years, and are reporting improved lung function, no mention of any tumors, or any respiratory problems at all. Actually 1 guy that I\u2019ve been talking with said he had his Dr prescribe it off label due to the fact that he had asthma. After a short time using Afrezza, his asthma seemed to vanish. His spirometer tests that he gets every 6 months are showing improved lung function. And again, his A1c has been in the high 5\u2019s, and since he started using Afrezza, Hypoglycemia has also vanished. It seems that the time profile, or the speed of Afrezza, (peaks in 12 minutes, and is out of the system in about 2 hours), keeps people from ever going high at mealtimes, and also prevents Hypoglycemia because it\u2019s out of the system before digestion is complete, so there is no insulin hanging around after digestion, causing dangerous lows, and resulting in aggressive eating. I guess, if what the people using Afrezza are claiming is true, why are they having problems getting their insurance to cover. And why are some Endocrinologists against prescribing it. Many of these people are also using a Dexcom CGM, the data in these glucose meters can\u2019t be altered or changed. Their caregivers must see this data when they download it at their appointments. If it\u2019s as good as they claim, it would seem they would want all patients that can tolerate Inhaled Insulin to at least try it. I actually joined this group after a very frustrating appointment with my Father in Laws Endocrinologists. My Father in Law is basically flying blind !! His insurance has approved a CGM for him, but for some unknown reason, he doesn\u2019t have it yet. If I was an Endocrinologists, I would want all my T1d patients to have a CGM. This would allow them to see the low coming before they are actually low, and take corrective action to avoid it. My Father in Law suffers from dangerous lows almost weekly, and he lives on the other side of the Country, so I can only do so much to help him. I just returned from Florida, I went there specifically to go with him to his appointment, and to ask his Endocrinologists why he doesn\u2019t have a CGM yet, and why can\u2019t he try a sample of this \u201clife changing\u201d Inhaled Insulin. I felt like I was talking to a rock !! and not a very smart one. Luckily, my Father in Law lives in Iowa in the summer, so I have scheduled another trip, so I can be with him at his appointment when he gets back from Florida. Again, my question is, if the new Inhaled Insulin, Afrezza, is really as good as many claim, why the resistance from Insurance Companies and Healthcare Providers ?? Why not at least let the patients who want to, try a sample ??  I appreciate any responses, obviously I was a little frustrated after my visit with the Florida Endocrinologists, my Father-in-law constantly suffers from Hypoglycemia, and his Dr doesn\u2019t seem to care. I do care, and I will do whatever I need to do to ensure he gets better care.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

You're thirsty, you're fatigued, nose is running, joints may be achy, you're gaining (or losing) weight, unintentionally. You feel crappy, stressed-out and, emotionally, a pain in the butt.  When you're blood sugar is normalized, it's the opposite. Appetite is strong, you have plenty of energy, you sleep well at night and vitals are stable (aka homeostasis).   I'm 62. I walk my local golf course (6300 yds) in under 3:45 hrs...in 100 degrees, last week! If my blood sugar was not properly regulated, I would have collapsed after a few holes. This is the beauty of Type 2 Diabetes \"reversal\". I know (and clearly grasp) how it \"feels\" to be on \"both sides of the fence\". In other words, I have a \"meter\" in my head, now. Bottomline: People say Type 2 Diabetes is the \"silent killer\". Bull!  CHRONIC high blood sugar negatively impacts every aspect of human physiology. As a result, your performance, mental acuity and behavior are all affected!  There is a clear and undeniable \"symptomology\" between unregulated blood sugar and Type 2 Diabetes. High blood sugar is simply ONE way to measure Type 2 Diabetes. Body temperature, blood pressure and weight are affected, just as well. You just never bothered to open your eyes, is all.

{"threadId": "Hello. Info", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Hello,  I have had T1D for 17 yrs now as of April (diagnosed at 6), so I will try to share a bit of information with you, but am willing to help more if you'd like. First off, as already mentioned, getting educated and setup with a specialist would be my focus (I have always seen an Endocrinologist and have had great success). These forums are great, but having a medical prof. looking at your boyfriend's glucose readings/A1C/blood work can help you two know how to tackle this thing. There's so much to learn at the beginning that it WILL feel overwhelming. That's ok. Your boyfriend is obviously lucky to have someone that is willing and wants to help him control his health and his future. Just a couple tips I'd give: always try to bolus (fast-acting insulin) before meals. This keeps me in check with what I am eating, because if I do X amount of units, I know I can only eat X carbs without another correction. Also, ALWAYS carry some kind of snack/juice/candy to get his blood sugar up if it plummets. I emphasize always because I have been hospitalized simply because I didn't have anything on me and didn't have access to it either. Lastly, know that diabetes will probably not be going anywhere anytime soon. In other words, and it already sounds like you are, but mentally & emotionally, be ready to be in this for the long haul. There will be great days and there will be terrible days. The only thing you & your boyfriend can do is to keep trying, learning & making adjustments. I apologize this turned into a novel. Feel free to email if you have questions. I'm happy to share what I have learned.

Answer: A bill from a healthcare agency.  ...That should tell you all you need to know about just how whacked out, how ludicrous, how outrageous our healthcare system is...the doctors, the hospitals, the insurance companies, the pharmaceutical companies...they are charging whatever they want and we're paying it, no questions asked.  You think I'm blowing smoke? You think it's not that bad? You think I'm being a drama queen?

It is pushing 18% of national income, compared with 10% to 12% of national income in the other high-income countries.  *None of this is rocket science. Nor is the United States too dumb to figure out what Canada, the UK, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Austria, Belgium, Korea and others have solved. The problem is not our intelligence. The problem is our corrupt political system, which caters to the health care lobby, not to the needs of the people.    Day after day, I read, post after heartbreaking post, people desperate for answers: \"I'm afraid...I think I have diabetes...What should I do?...Should I be worried?...\" Is this what Americans get for $10,000 worth of medical spending by the medical industry and the politicians that facilitate this charade while they hold one congressional meeting after another, explaining that it's \"the other party\" or \"the White House\" that's preventing us from receiving healthcare that actually improves our health and keeps us informed.  $10,000 per citizen in the US. Are YOU getting your money's worth? If that were true, why are you, here? Why are you asking crucial life-and-death questions to complete strangers with unknown or, at the very least, questionable credentials?  All I can say to anyone that will listen: Can I please have my $10,000 in cash cause the companies my government is giving it to for my \"benefit\" does absolutely nothing for me. I mean it! I used to get angry when I read about how some doctor or lawyer fled the country after scamming Medicare or Medicaid for several hundred million in fraudulent claims. Now, I just stop reading and go look at some porn. Think about it. Whose gonna notice a few hundred million bucks missing in a budget of 3.25 TRILLION?  This is what Washington and every state government has quietly perpetrated, in collusion with healthcare, to make Americans just \"look the other way\". Bills that never get looked at are a license to steal. $10,000/yr and you can't even get an appointment? At what point will people scream, \"enough is enough!\"?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

{"threadId": "What Do You Do To \"Fight\" Diabetes?", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Brunosbud, I like your thread because it matches my own philosophies with diabetes and lifestyle. However, with me at least, my \"battles\" with diabetes have never been a \"fight; not even a \"struggle\". It has become such a normal part of my routine that most of the things that you discuss were adopted many, many years ago. They are almost an automatic reflex.  That's why I don't spend much time \"attending\" to my diabetes nor have I ever struggled with burnout. If my blood sugars are high (based on my blood glucose test meter), I know what I need to do and just do it, almost without having to think about it. For that reason, I have never experienced burnout nor depression in \"fighting\" diabetes.  Please continue to post here is this thread. That is where philosophy belongs and it may be very helpful to others. However, the healthy tips and lifestyle that you advocate only work for a small percentage because only a small percentage will ever follow through and actually try them. And, of course, there is the time factor involved. Healthy living will have benefits down the road, in the future; not necessarily in the here and now.  If the patient is suffering damage to their bodies now/today, they cannot rely solely on lifestyle changes to stop the damage and restore them to health within a short time frame. In fact, they may even think your advice is not helpful and may become discouraged. That's the main reason why I do not feel that posting tips such as these in OTHER threads is likely to address the poster's more immediate issues; it could even turn some of them off.  Expanding your collection of tips in this thread will be most useful to those who enjoy expanding their knowledge and should provide additional food for thought. But its unlikely to persuade the unwashed masses until they have sufficient courage to actually try some of these things for themselves not to mention having the patience to wait for the results, if any. No, they won't necessarily work for everyone. And the problem won't be due to insulin resistance. Instead, I call it patient resistance.  But then, we're all different so nothing is going to work the same for everyone. We have to do our own due diligence and learn how to \"listen to our own bodies.\" Therein lies the true path to controlling our individual diabetes. Did you know, for example, that our microbiome/microbiota can play a significant role in obesity and diabetes? The many research studies that I have read in this field have been extremely enlightening with much more yet to come.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

Type 2 Diabetes is a disease to 1. Reverse (which I have), or 2. Prevent T2 Diabetes is NOT a disease to \"treat\".  The problem is not that people like diabetes...

This is the freakin' problem: \"Recipe to losing weight | Anna Verhulst\"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfK3eK-kOQA  Weight loss is (c.) \"COMPLEX PROBLEM\". There is no \"recipe\" we can all follow to achieve success. Successful, predictable healthcare outcomes cannot be achieved without controls to what people actually shove in their pieholes! No healthcare program, whose ever \"name\" precedes it, can ever overcome a reckless, irresponsible attitude towards one's own health.

I just don't believe I can help the average T2 diabetic whose been brainwashed into believing Type 2 Diabetes is a disease that can be \"treated\" or \"controlled\".  The healthcare industry knows...The politicians know...The drug companies know...The health insurance companies know...The advertisers know...Everyone affiliated with medicine, all know...Trying to provide healthcare to a country \"irrespective of diet\" is neither a \"simple\" nor \"complicated\" problem. Healthcare, without establishing a minimum baseline of knowledge of what's healthy to eat and what's not, makes it \"complex\"!  It's not that I don't care, nutrijoy. It's too \"complex\". We need to begin the process of educating our children of the importance of healthy diet and daily exercise. This way, they will understand what their parents cannot.  You don't treat T2D.

{"threadId": "What Do You Do To \"Fight\" Diabetes?", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                Too many people, patients and healthcare professional alike, tend to blame obesity as being the primary cause of T2 diabetes and, by association, the patient\u2019s inability to control their appetite (i.e., overeating) or lack of sufficient exercise (i.e., slovenly lifestyle). I have never embraced that theory because I personally know lots of skinny T2 diabetics who are reasonably active but still come down with diabetes. Jenny Ruhl wrote an article many years ago that you can read on her website, BloodSugar101:  http://www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/14046739.php  It was written quite a few years ago but has not gained much traction. Just shows that people just like to believe what they want to believe. But recent discoveries about the microorganisms which reside in our microbiome tends to toss the entire obesity theory on its head. It first began nearly a decade ago when doctors began experimenting with fecal/stool transplants to treat serious cases of IBS and infections of Clostridiuum difficile. The latter, in particular, is often resistant to conventional treatments, including antibiotics, and a fecal/stool transplant can literally be a life-saving procedure.  But here\u2019s where it gets interesting. Quite a few years ago, I read about a woman who underwent the procedure and the donor was a cousin who was overweight/borderline obese. Shortly after receiving stool from her healthy but overweight cousin, her infection successfully went away but she began to suddenly and unexpectedly gain weight herself. Yet her diet and lifestyle were the same as it had been before the transplant. At the time, her doctor was at a loss for an explanation. But now hundreds of people who have received stool from overweight donors have also reported unexplained weight gain despite making zero changes in their diets or lifestyle activities. Clearly, something in the microbiome was causing the weight gain. You can easily read dozens, perhaps hundreds of reports of this phenomenon by simply typing \u201cweight gain after stool transplant\u201d into your favorite search engine.  This definitely suggests that something in the gut is responsible for this weird turn in events and has nothing to do with what a person eats nor how much they\u2019re eating. Lifestyle also does NOT appear to be a factor in these cases of sudden weight gain; only that if the donor was obese, there\u2019s a good chance that the recipient will become likewise. I could expand on this in greater detail, if you like, including the possible causes and the name of a microbe (found in the gut) that has been able to actually cause weight loss (special circumstances, of course) in the very limited experiments that have been done (so far). However, too many of my posts are too wordy than I prefer so I\u2019ll end this post now. But \u2026 if those who read your thread want to know more, I\u2019ll be happy to expand on this topic in a future post. Do, however, do your search for \u201cweight gain after stool transplant\u201d and read some of those articles first. They might answer most of the questions you might have regarding this microbiome-related phenomenon.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

{"threadId": "What Do You Do To \"Fight\" Diabetes?", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    This was posted by member, \"nutrijoy\", recently in another thread\"....  \u201cThis TEDx talk by Dr. Sarah Hallberg is one that I recommend all PWDs should watch, whether they are Type 1, 2, 1.5 (LADA), MODY, or something undefined:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da1vvigy5tQ  Dr. Hallberg\u2019s presentation is a shade over 18 minutes long but contains a wealth of solid information. I disagree with her video title about \u201creversing\u201d diabetes but her suggestions are all pretty much spot on. Be sure to read some of the viewers\u2019 comments posted on the YouTube page, however. The negative posts far outnumber the positives. Does that mean she is wrong or out-of-sync? Actually, as a seasoned veteran (over 15 years and counting) of insulin-dependent diabetes with an A1c under 5.4 during those many years, I can categorically state that the negative reviews come from people who either don\u2019t have diabetes themselves or just don\u2019t know the difference between their posterior orifice and a terrestrial aperture. But, I should add, that is only my personal opinion...\"   I have referenced Dr. Hallberg's Tedx talk, several times, in my posts, as well. I, too, agree with nutrijoy that most of what she says is quite valid. The key point to her discussion is concerning the hormone, \"INSULIN\". Because most people will never bother to watch her Ted Talk discussion, allow me to highlight what she says about \"INSULIN\" in her discussion.  A. \"Insulin's job is to drive blood sugar into the cells where it can be used.\" B. \"Most people who are obese are insulin RESISTANT...they have trouble getting blood sugar (into the cells) where it needs to go.\" C. \"The body's response to insulin RESISTANCE is to just make more of it and insulin levels will just rise and rise...\" D. \"More than 50% of the adult population now have either diabetes or prediabetes.\" E. \"People have elevated insulin levels due to insulin RESISTANCE for years and years, decades even, long before the diagnosis of even \"prediabetes\" is made...\" F. \"It's estimated that even 16 to 25% of \"normal\" weighted adults have insulin \"RESISTANCE\". G. \"So the problem with insulin resistance is, you are at \"great\" risk to developing diabetes...\" H. \"....but, also, insulin makes us HUNGRY!...Insulin is our FAT STORAGE hormone.\" I. \"Everything we eat is either a fat, protein or carbohydrate and each has a different affect on insulin...\" J. \"When we eat fat, we get a flatline (it does nothing to insulin levels).\" K. \"So, if you're insulin RESISTANT and your insulin levels are already higher, you really are HUNGRIER...all the time!\" L. \"So, if you eat CARBS>>>Glucose goes up>>>Insulin goes up>>>Hunger & Fat Storage (results).\" M. \"The general recommendations for Type 2 Diabetes patients, today, is to consume 45-60 grams of carbohydrate per meal. We (doctors) are recommending to eat exactly what is causing our problem! Sound crazy? It really, really is!!!\" N. \"The American Diabetes Association guidelines specifically state, 'There is inconclusive evidence to recommend a specific carbohydrate limit and, since, carbohydrate intake is the single, greatest factor in blood sugar levels, we need medication (to treat diabetes).\" O. \"&, hey, look. If you're taking diabetes medications, you actually have to eat carbs! Otherwise, your blood sugar can go too low (hypoglycemic comatose)...\" P. \"So, here's the vicious cycle (of taking diabetes drugs prescribed by your physician) \"they\" set up for you: 1. Eat carbs>>>2. Take diabetes medicine>>>3. Eat MORE carbs to avoid going too \"low\" from taking the medication.............and, around and around and around we go!\" Q. \"No where in the ADA guidelines is the role of REVERSING Type 2 Diabetes!\" R. \"Our minimum daily requirement for carbohydrates? Zero...we don't need to eat carbohydrates.\" S. \"(Why the ADA guidelines in conflict with the latest studies in HIGH FAT/LOW CARB diets) Don't be fooled; There's a lot of money to be made by keeping you sick.\" T. \"So, the solution to the diabetes epidemic is becoming exceedingly clear: STOP USING MEDICINE TO TREAT FOOD.\"  What I want to make clear to anyone reading this thread: 1. I \"reversed\" my Type 2 Diabetes almost 10 years ago and have not had a single A1C test result over 5.5 (5.3 in the last 5 years). 2. I refused to take diabetes, cholesterol and blood pressure drugs despite recommendations by my physician. 3. I am still insulin resistant; I just don't \"test\" as T2 diabetes or prediabetes. 4. Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes are as similar as dogs to cats. Type 1 diabetics cannot survive without insulin intervention. They need it because they don't produce enough (or any) to live! 5. 95% of the diabetics in this country are TYPE 2. Type 1 Diabetes is rare compared to Type 2. 6. As soon as changed my diet and improved the \"Basic\" of my lifestyle, my A1C dropped, IMMEDIATELY. Again, no drugs!  So, this is my \"soapbox\" (and, Dr. Hallberg's, of course). You ever wonder why you don't see the millions of other Type 2 diabetes viewing these threads on webmd, all over the world, chiming in to defend their \"treatment\" of T2D? How come no diabetes doctor's coming forward to call me a liar; That T2 Diabetes is NOT REVERSIBLE and cannot be eliminated without the use of diabetes medications?  Thus, push me off my soapbox. Share with us what you know. If you can call my advice \"worthless\", that's perfectly OK. But, at least have the stones, to share in your wisdom. That's the minimum price, at least, if you're going to criticize me. PS: My nephew and all his college buddies are presently consuming 3, 4 or 5 times the minimum ADA recommended carbohydrate levels per meal. They are young, strong and full of energy. They can operate on tilt, sunup to sundown, without a break. When they go for a doctor checkup, they never test for elevated fasting blood glucose. NEVER...  So, tell me. Does that mean they're \"safe\"? Must be...that's what their doctor tells 'em.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

{"threadId": "What Do You Do To \"Fight\" Diabetes?", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Almost 9 out of 10 Type 2 Diabetics are overweight. Losing just 5 to 10% bodyweight could mean the difference between taking diabetes medications or controlling the disease (and possibly reversing it, entirely) through diet and exercise. In other words, \"bodyfat\" loss is closely tied to insulin resistance and, more often than not, the key to resolving T2D.  So, if that's the case, what's the big deal? Lose weight and normal blood sugar regulation is restored. Easy, right?  Wrong! Permanent weight loss is the Holy Grail of medicine. If I could put fat loss in a bottle, I could make Bill Gates my regular Uber driver. I could make Warren Buffet my private shopper. I could make Vladimir Putin fetch my morning paper.  Here's my secret to weight loss. It's so stupid easy, too... 1. Lots of water 2. Daily exercise 3. Eat the same healthy things, morning noon and night.  Salmon. Eggs. Sweet potato. Avocado. Broccoli. Cherries. Walnuts. Cabbage. Beans. Spinach. Apples. Bone broth... It doesn't matter, just as long as it's a fresh whole food. I don't even put a limit on how much I eat! I can eat until I gag...as long as it's the same healthy thing...everyday...morning, noon and night.  If every Type 2 Diabetic just bit the bullet, the disease would vanish. So would High Blood Pressure. So would coronary artery disease. No more stroke or heart attacks. No more cancer. If I was president, I'd put this in the tax code! You maintain the same healthy diet, EVERYDAY, I will drop $10,000 in your bank account...tomorrow!...for each member of your entire freakin family!!!!  Weight loss (more accurately, \"fat\" loss), even if you're just a few pounds overweight, can make a huge difference. Ask any diabetes physician. They will concur. If you make minor improvements to your lifestyle, you will see the difference in your blood sugar reads, immediately.   But, that's not what Type 2 Diabetics are told to \"focus\" on...They're told to control high blood sugar through drugs. And, by doing that rather than investing their entire effort into eating, fresh and non-processed, and walking, everyday and drinking way more water than they're drinking, now...They get \"worse\". Type 2 Diabetes is allowed to progress.  Do you wanna know what Type 2 Diabetes can do to your body when it's allowed to progress? Do you have any idea? Unless you work in an E.R. and see the results of uncontrolled blood sugar on a routine basis, you wouldn't know the devastation this disease can manifest.  Read each and every post, here, and you will see. 99% are essentially, clueless. They simply don't know what to do. They are barking up every wrong tree except weight loss! If people did know (how to correctly treat T2D), why in the world would they need this board? Answer: People don't know a thing about Type 2 Diabetes. That's why.  And, the same posts are repeated year after year after year. Nothing that's asked, here, today, is any different than what was asked 20 years ago. They spin their wheels researching drugs and sham supplements and insipid health aids, instead. They go on \"diets\" every six months. They make New Year resolutions that never last. People don't ever consider to eat the same thing, everyday...just like every other animal on the face of this planet! That just makes too much sense to wrap their brains around.  And, you know what? Despite however easy it is to \"cure\" this disease (and every other horrid lifestyle disease) for the rest of their lifetime, people will go on measuring their \"blood sugar\" and continue to take the pills, regardless of outcome. As long as they refuse to lose the weight, permanently, as long as they deny the connection between weight gain and insulin resistance, as long as they remain ignorant of the link between metabolic syndrome and Type 2 Diabetes, diabetes will continue to be big business.

On the other hand, if you\u2019re concerned about ketoacidosis, which is much more serious, even potentially fatal if not treated, that is quite another matter. However, it usually affects Type 1 diabetics, not Type 2 because it normally is the result of extremely high blood sugars and insufficient or no insulin, one of the dangers of Type 1. Side effects from some medications can also cause ketoacidosis that can affect anyone. If you have a blood glucose testing meter, please check your blood sugars and post your reading.

The difference is that a diabetic's blood glucose will remain high and not go back down to \"normal\" levels as quickly or easily. Most prescription pain medications affect the body in the same way.

If you just found out you were diabetic yesterday, do you know whether you were diagnosed as Type 1 or Type 2? If you're concerned about ketone levels, you can purchase a product called Ketostix in virtually an pharmacy/drug store. It is an over-the-counter product and is a urine-based test. Simply dip a Ketostix into a urine sample, wait the specified amount of time, and compare the color on the strip with a chart that's included. It will tell you how high your level of ketones is.

Usually you can obtain one from your doctor for free (usually includes ten starter test strips). They can also be purchased from any drug store without a prescription but the strips can be expensive without insurance. I recommend people who pay-out-pocket to go for the Accu-Chek Guide meter and strips. You can get the meter free and test strips are reasonably priced under their SimplePay program:  https://www.accu-chek.com/microsites/guide-simplepay?utm_campaign=Guide&amp;utm_medium=Inactive_URL&utm_content=ACCM/microsites/guide/simplepay.html&utm_source=Inactive_URL  I use these myself and I buy 300 strips at a time for $69 (meter is free).

Are you male or female, what do you do for exercise, what is your approximate weight and height, and what are you currently on for medications?  The only way to bring your A1C down is to reduce your carb intake, increase your exercise and talk to your doctor about your medications. The reason I ask the questions above is because the carb vs. exercise vs. weight & height, is different for each person.  For example: a female who weighs approximately 200 lbs at 5'6\", with a sedentary lifestyle would need to exercise approximately 15 minutes, 5 times a week, by taking a slow to medium paced walk on flat ground then increase every 2 weeks by 5 minutes and increasing the speed after 3 weeks to a moderate pace, etc. Carb intake should be approximately 175-190 carbs a day.  But for a male who is 250 lbs at 5' 10\", with a moderately heavy job, but liked his beer, I would recommend cutting back to no more than 2 beers every other day AT MOST. Lower his carb intake to no more than 250 carbs a day and increase exercise approximately 30 minutes of moderate exercise 4 times a week.

{"threadId": "Have not been diagnosed diabetic!", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Ok, so first off, you are probably not type 1 diabetic. See if you can make an appointment with an endocrinologist. This doctor specializes in diseases of the hormones, which includes insulin. Blood sugar problems have numerous forms:  Type 1 Diabetes: Usually called Juvenile Diabetes, most are born with this. Or have converted from,  Type 2 Diabetes:  Insulin Resistance: (This is straight from WebMD website) What is insulin resistance? Does it mean you're going to get type 2 diabetes? If your doctor has told you that you have this condition, you're probably asking these questions. It means your body can't respond properly to the insulin it makes. Over time, this sends your blood sugar levels up. That can set you up for type 2 diabetes, as well as heart disease, but it doesn't have to. Exercise and a good diet can help you stay healthy.  Hypoglycemia: (This is quoted directly from WebMD) Hypoglycemia is low blood sugar. It is considered a symptom, not a disease. Hypoglycemia most commonly occurs in people who take certain diabetes medications. However, low blood sugar may also be due to abnormal hormone levels or sensitivity to certain body hormones, gastric surgery, a tumor of the pancreas, and genetic disorders that interfere with the body's ability to breakdown certain food substances, such as fruit sugar. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include shakiness, hunger, lightheadedness, and sweating. People with severe hypoglycemia may pass out. Meal plan or medication changes may help treat hypoglycemia. Follow the links below to find WebMD's comprehensive coverage about how hypoglycermia occurs, what the symptoms are, how to treat it, and much more.  Symptoms of type 2 Diabetes are: Increased thirst Increased hunger (especially after eating) Dry mouth Frequent urination Unexplained weight loss (even though you are eating and feel hungry) Fatigue (weak, tired feeling) Blurred vision Headaches Loss of consciousness (rare)  I know this is a lot of information, but it gives you a place to start. Start a food journal along with your blood glucose levels. You should test: As soon as you get up, 2 hours after breakfast, just before lunch, 2 hours after lunch, just before supper and 2 hours after, then just before bed. Note any additional foods/snacks you are having. If your feeling the lows, make sure you carry Glucose tablets with you. When you you feel shakey, nauseous, light headed, or clammy, check your sugars (if possible) then take the recommended amount of glucose tablets on the container. If it doesn't give one, try 1 at a time and wait approximately 3-5 minutes between each one. They should work pretty quickly as they are pretty much straight glucose, but the 3-5 minutes gives your body enough time to see how your shakes go. Once the shakes go away, or you feel better, you will need to note how many Glucose tablets you took, and over what period of time it took to make you feel better. Remember it can take a while to get a diagnosis, there are tests and other stuff. But if you honestly think you could be diabetic, then an endocrinologist is the one to see.

But, I also eat, daily, eggs, seeds, cheese, cottage cheese & avocados. All of these foods are staples of a ketogenic diet plan. Plus, I perform moderate exercise (over two sessions), 90 minutes, daily.  Here's the key to any diet. If you need to lose weight, a proper diet will result in weight loss. If you need to gain weight, a proper diet will result in weight gain. And, if you don't need to lose or gain weight, a proper diet will keep you right where you want to be for years and years.  The human body is both a scorecard and test lab. After years of studying diet, (on myself) I've reached a blanket conclusion. Diet aint \"rocket science\". You can pretty much live a life free of obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol or Type 2 Diabetes provided you don't eat lots of foods that contain ingredients you can't pronounce. And, since restaurants can't profit if their food is continuously \"perishing\", guess what most Americans eat on a routine basis?  Modern medicine treats all patients regardless of what they eat.

Often, the time is something that you really can\u2019t afford because high blood sugars are doing extreme damage to your body including the destruction of your remaining beta cells NOW. The reason why so many diabetics are complacent when it comes to high blood sugars is due to two main factors: 1.&nbsp;Really bad advice from established \u201cprotocols\u201d (that includes too many members of the medical community) that mislead diabetics into believing that high blood sugars are \u201cOK\u201d; that \u201cyou\u2019re doing fine.\u201d 2.&nbsp;The damage caused by elevated blood sugars is largely asymptomatic, i.e., you don\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d anything while your body is being destroyed. It can take many years before the symptoms actually surface and, by that time, it is often too late.  The BloodSugar101 website does provide information on the research that connects organ damage with blood sugar level. You can find it here:  http://www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/14045678.php  Good luck.

Reduce inflammation: Manage/control stress. Move your body. Improve sleep quality (cpap) Cut out sugar!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Premature wrinkles, hair loss, turkey neck are good examples, too. The eyes are fantastic \"windows\" of internal inflammation. Tooth decay, ditto.

This is on the WEBMD website:   http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-2-diabetes-guide/reversing-type-2-diabetes#1  \"...In one study, people with type 2 diabetes exercised for 175 minutes a week, limited their calories to 1,200 to 1,800 per day, and got weekly counseling and education on these lifestyle changes...Within a year, about 10% got off their diabetes medications or improved to the point where their blood sugar level was no longer in the diabetes range, and was instead classified as prediabetes. ...Results were best for those who lost the most weight or who started the program with less severe or newly diagnosed diabetes. Fifteen percent to 20% of these people were able to stop taking their diabetes medications.\"    Why does Type 2 diabetes reversal work for some and not others?  The answer is simple: Type 2 Diabetes is not caused by too much blood sugar. It is caused by too much insulin. Have you not heard the phrase, \"Insulin Resistance\" instead of diabetes?  What happens when a heroin addict uses too much heroin? He builds a \"heroin resistance\". What happens when an alcoholic drinks too much? He builds a \"alcohol resistance\". In other words, by using too much of any drug over prolonged periods of time, your body becomes less and less sensitive to its affects, thereby, requiring increasing amounts to accomplish the desired affect...to get high, to get loaded...or, to clear your blood stream of too much glucose.   So, tell me. Why is it, all Type 2 Diabetics try to reduce Blood Sugar when the problem with their body is, they've built a \"resistance (or insensitivity) to insulin\" ?  The argument, of course, is: Well, what's the big deal? What's the difference between high blood sugar and high insulin?  A huge difference!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If too much insulin is the true root cause of T2 D, then why in the world is everybody taking drugs that RAISE insulin levels (to treat this disease).  After reading this, you probably are not convinced. You will go on taking meds and trying to reduce blood sugar just like everybody with diabetes.  Just answer me this, then? Why is it, all the diabetes drug takers keep having to dose more drugs, yet, their diabetes continues to \"progress\" over time? How come it never gets better, only, worse?  Answer: Because they never ask their doctor the following question: \"If my problem is \"insulin resistance\", shouldn't I be trying to use less insulin, not more?...Can you explain it to me like I'm a five year old, please?\"  After 10 years participation on this board, not one person has ever come forward and explained how lowering blood sugar reduces insulin resistance. ZERO. Not even a physician!  People are reversing Type 2 Diabetes, all the time, through proper diet, exercise and proper weight loss (low carb, high fat, intermittent fasting). It is impossible to reverse this disease by increasing insulin use/production. You can throw all the drugs you want at T2D; it will fail, regardless. At the end of the day, nobody can eat processed foods, long term, and get away with it. Nobody!<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

They are essential component in boosting immunity and, hence, protecting the host from other quite serious infectious disease. The same principal applies for running a temperature. In normally healthy kids, 95% run to their doctor and demand antibiotics. But, the other 5% say, \"Hey, fever is not only a normal physical reaction, its essential to \"delivering\" immunity and is simply the human body's way of destroying pathogens without killing the host.

Not so harmless if allowed to persist and become \"chronic\". In actuality, if a fever is allowed to rage, non stop, for prolonged periods, the consequences can be grave and life-threatening.  Now, everybody knows, fever is not the \"problem\" but rather it's the \"symptom\"...the result...of an infection (bacteria, venom, virus, toxin, yada, yada, yada). Thus, \"treating\" a fever is pointless if you don't get rid of the source of the infection, first. Luckily for all of us, though, running a high temperature generally destroys most pathogens and, eventually, kids only miss a few days of school and big kids only miss a few days of work.

High insulin IS!  ...And, what causes our body to produce mass amounts of insulin to course through your veins? What's the true root cause of diabetes?  Answer: Sugar: People will shove anything down their pie holes if it's got sugar in it. And, unfortunately, sugar is a helluva lot more addictive then heroin. That's why.  Maybe, your doctor believes \"this\"...And, maybe he wants you to go as long as you can with the metformin plus a very, strict, sugar free diet and daily exercise...and skip the booze; drink plenty of water because liver and kidneys are huge in proper blood sugar regulation...and, get lots of sleep because that's when 90% of tissue repair/healing occurs...and, chill out and try not to freak out over every little thing because chronic stress and worry destroys an immune system...and, maybe, contrary to what all the other \"sheep\" believe, a1c rises with age (as does weight, blood pressure and cholesterol) ...and, last but not least, maybe he thinks the last thing a diabetic needs...  ...is more insulin.

I will just share that for 30+ years my MIL has TD2 and was seeing her primary doctor who never ordered an HBA1C. She just reported her home glucose readings and the doctor adjusted her insulin levels using those numbers only. When that doctor retired a few years ago, my wife got her mom in with our primary doctor. Our doctor ordered an HBA1C and that came back as 10.2. There was already irreversible kidney damage and she had to start dialysis. She passed away this past April.  So, as mrscora01 said the HBA1C or the fasting glucose numbers are not the whole picture. Both are usually used to determine diagnosis and proper treatment. Continue to take your glucose readings at home, but more frequently - a fasting each morning and at least one other during the day 2 hours after eating. Continue to eat a healthy, lower carb diet and get as much exercise as possible.  In May 2014 my HBA1C was 9.5. I had not been consistently eating or exercising properly, even though I knew what to do since I was diagnosed in 2001. My doctor added glyburide and insulin to my metformin. That was a wake-up call, so I started working and am still working at being more consistent with healthy eating and activity.

People with digestive issues (ibs, gastric reflux, colitis, celiacs and chrohn's, hemorrhoids, diverticulitis) tend to have diabetes, eventually. As you improve your digestion (drink more water, exercise, fruits/veggies, fermented foods, more sleep, apple cider vinegar), you will reduce inflammation in the gut and, in turn, use L E S S insulin. The less insulin your body requires, the greater your body's \"sensitivity\" to insulin. Stool quality and frequency is a wonderful \"indicator\" of good digestion and, therefore, better health.   Again, fixating on \"blood sugar\" control does nothing for Type 2 because high blood sugar is just a reaction (aka \"symptom\") to problem(s), elsewhere.  Conversely, people who address/correct \"root cause(s)\" of high blood sugar are the ones who eventually reverse Type 2 Diabetes.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

Every nationally recognized material I have been reading says 5.6 is what a non-diabetic has. 5.7 would be pre diabetic and 6 is where you want to be for type 2. Your levels are way to high.

Basically, your fasting levels are near my diagnosed levels when they had me on insulin (nightmare) and your A1C is average for a type 1 diabetic.  It sounds like your kidney and liver functions should be tested (this should be 6-12 months every year), as well as a general blood comprehensive test and to find a new endocrinologist. What you are being told is wrong  I was told, when still on insulin my levels should be 115 fasting as a max, 120-140 after eating, and A1C of 7 or lower. Since I had a horrible reaction to insulin they put me on metformin. I believe they will lower my levels ago since I keep going hypo. But if I reach 200 that is an odd day. I am at 85-90 fasting 115 after eating.  I would change your diet, get some major blood work done and find a new doctor who will also coordinate with your PCP and possibly a nutritionist.

Once she started drinking half her body weight in water, the cramps subsided and her overall health noticeably improved, too.  People over the age 50 are the absolute worst at this, especially, women! Weight issues, digestive issues, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol are all affected by hydration levels. It such a simple fix and, yet, they don't listen to their doctor.  Experiment with water levels. Take selfies in the bathroom mirror and try a 30 day trial, one half your body weight in water.

There are plenty of medications your doctor can prescribe to help you keep your blood glucose levels down, but diet and exercise are still needed and seem to be working for you. There are medications that can help with the burning pain, aka diabetic neuropathy. Many people who keep their glucose levels in the normal range consistently do have a reduction of those symptoms.  What exactly are you thinking is the \"normal\" range? An HBA1C result of less than 6.0% would be normal. Between 6.0 and 7.0 are considered \"controlled\" but still may cause complications like neuropathy. Fasting Blood Glucose levels of 70-100 are normal. 101-125 are pre-diabetic. 126+ is full diabetes.  If your results are within the range I posted and have been for a while, then your neuropathy may be caused by a different condition. A neurologist could find the cause of the burning. When not caused by high glucose readings then the correct term is \"peripheral neuropathy\" and could be caused by spinal problems or circulatory issues.  True reversal of diabetes takes a consistent lifestyle change with a proper diet and regular activity. Any of those advertised pills, supplements or programs are most likely scams.

Directly, T2D can affect kidney function resulting in excessive protein in urine (a symptom of kidney damage or failure). Indirectly, T2D commonly causes bladder, kidney or urinary tract infections, especially, fools that don't drink enough water. Asparagus can cause cloudy, smelly urine. People who o.d. on vitamins and supplements (thinking, \"Ohhhhhhh, that's my problem!), can get cloudy piss issues. Bottomline: cloudy pee is a sign that should not be ignored cuz it aint \"normal\".

Do you think that's a good idea?    fyi, one way to tell if your blood sugar is out of whack: spill a little pee on the sidewalk and see if the ants come. A normal kidney can handle up to 200 mg/dL.

High blood sugar is a byproduct of that inflammation. Therefore, it is not the cause of Type 2 Diabetes. It's just a \"symptom\".  When you eat a proper diet focused on sound nutrition and anti-oxidation, chronic inflammation will subside and eventually your body will methodically repair, itself. That means, the major \"symptoms\" of chronic inflammation: 1. high blood sugar 2. weight gain 3. high blood pressure 4. high triglycerides  will gradually return to normal levels!  Weight loss, as a result of eating a predominantly green diet with little to no \"processed\" food, is a classic sign of Type 2 Diabetes \"reversal\". Water retention is a common byproduct of internal inflammation so when inflammation is reduced, there's less need for your body to hold on to excessive amounts of water. Each gallon of water at sea level is roughly 9 lbs and our bodies are made up mostly of water. In other words, it don't take much water loss to make a big difference in weight.

The only reason I know I was a mess was because I kept detailed \"diabetes logs & notes\".  ...and, the only reason you're not concerned, now? It's because you don't remember how you felt when you were \"hot\" and you don't keep \"detailed\" diabetes logs.  Start writing, everyday. On a scale of 1 to 10, quantify severity of your \"symptoms\". Whether its tingling in the feet, U.T.I.s, joint pain, loose stools, PCOS, allergies, sweating...make observations and document. Your symptoms will tell you where you stand with your diabetes much faster than an A1C.  * Your medication dose is the ultimate tell tale sign of where you stand with diabetes. It's either going up or down. If it's slowly going up, you're in trouble...No one need tell you if you should be concerned. The faster your meds are increasing, the more trouble you're in.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

They weren't scared, then. But, now, when their doctor says, \"You have prediabetes or T2D.\", they're suddenly get \"scared\", now? They've had diabetes their whole dang life! Since, their mom gave them Cap'n Crunch and otter pops since they were 4 years old!!!!!!!!!  I don't fear T2D. I don't fear carbs. You don't have to anything as long as you eat real food, every meal. And, if you don't know what real food is, at this point in your life, fear that!  bottomline, you know you're doing good if ALL metabolics are \"reversing\" towards normality (NOT JUST BLOOD SUGAR!) because all vitals are reflective of internal inflammation, the root cause of T2D (and, heart disease...and, hypertension...and, alzheimer's...and, arthritis,...etc, etc, etc). And, if you want to get \"better\", faster, just eat real food, exclusively. That's all.  Doctors want the fear. They like the fear. Fear pays their mortgage.  This aint rocket science.

{"threadId": "Fasting Blood Sugar", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                annb54, I can't tell you, Ann. I don't have sufficient information about you to make any reasonable recommendations. Your doctor knows. But, your question is incredibly complex and his explanation would just confuse you , more, I'm afraid.  It's like asking a watch maker, \"How does a watch work?\" He knows but, he'll likely say tell you, \"For now, why don't we just to keep track of the time?\"  What I can share are the factors that had the greatest impact on me to lower my blood sugar numbers. I look at diabetes like having an injury. In any injury, you can't rush recovery. Plus, the weaker your body is, the slower the healing takes. What do I mean by \"weaker\"? 1. Family history 2. Age 3. If female, any bouts of gestational diabetes 4. Co-morbidities (especially, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, depression, arthritis, IBS, Gout) 5. Prescriptions 6. Alcohol, smoking 7. Social interaction (Are you alone? Do you have friends, attend church, etc?)  Finally, Lifestyle...the most impactful factor of all! 1. Rest and sleep 2. Overweight (weight loss is crucial)? 3. Stress management (Are you emotionally on tilt, regularly? Do you lack money? Are you abused?) 4. Exercise, daily? 5. Diet (What percentage of your diet is \"real\"food, ie. fruit, veggies, nuts, seeds, whole grains, lean proteins?)  The more real food you eat, the better. It's just that simple.  It's taken me \"years\" to learn what buttons I need to push to calm Type 2 Diabetes. I also know, now, that each person is different. No two people share the exact same factors that determine their levels of resistance to insulin. Zero. Not even siblings!  When you have a serious injury or are recovering from major surgery, you \"rehab\". You have to take very good care of your body, take things slow and easy, get plenty of rest, plus, make common sense decisions about exercise, diet, stress management, seeing friends and family.  But, most of all, you need to be patient. It takes time to ingrain changes to a lifestyle. Everybody wants big changes, fast. The weaker your body is, in its current state, the more time it will take to see improvements in blood sugar numbers.  How would you care for yourself if you were recovering from heart bypass surgery? I don't know you. I have no idea what \"common sense lifestyle decision making\" means to you. I know, there are a lot of people who think chips, cookies, soda and restaurant dining are perfectly OK and taking drugs and supplements are very \"sensible\". And, they believe that 10 or 20% extra weight is not a problem.  For me, my biggest lesson learned about Type 2 Diabetes? It's about using \"less\" insulin, not more! So, what affects hormone (like insulin) levels in the human body?  Food. Plus, every bloody thing else!  Blood sugar levels are simply elevated or lowered in response to rapid changes in circulating insulin levels in your body. Diabetics who fixate on \"manipulating\" blood sugar levels, in the end, realize...focusing on blood sugar has little to do with helping \"heal\" an \"injury\".<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

One of the biggest reasons the mediterranean diet works for weight loss, is because of avocados and garlic. Both, are especially powerful foods for your body's overall health and fitness.  I would add, drink lots of water and don't eat anything between dinner and breakfast the following morning (intermittent fasting).  The primary cause of high blood sugar is an inflammatory response to high levels of insulin caused by developing insulin resistance. Water cleans and calms the digestive tract. Intermittent fasting allows your G.I. tract a much needed break to allow for rest & repair.   Think about this for a minute... Why isn't there an \"established, long term cure\" for Type 2 Diabetes, yet people, everyday (myself, included), who have reversed their T2D and no longer need drugs to maintain normal blood glucose levels? Answer: Because, after 100 years of trying, everybody is still fixated on lowering their \"high blood sugar\". (See, \"lemmings jumping off cliffs\").  What will it take to convince you, \"manipulating\" high blood sugar doesn't work?

Is Albert Einstein wrong and everyone else, \"right\"?  Type 2 Diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity are all \"health\" issues... This is why fruits and vegetables \"work\" for these diseases! This is why daily exercise \"work\" for these diseases! This is why more rest and sleep work for these diseases! This is why drugs Don't Work (and never will) for these diseases! This is why emotional, physical, and psychological stress make these diseases worse! This is why avocado's work! This is why garlic works! This is why drinking more water works! The same things that have worked for the last million years, still work to this day! Holy moly! Who knew???!!! This is why all insurance companies give better \"rates\" (life, auto, homeowners, renters) to people that don't have Type 2 Diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol or obesity...  It's because all insurance companies know the same thing! That people who agree with Albert that it's \"insane\" to keep beating one's head against the same wall, day after day, those are the people they really want to insure!

In other words, they're high blood sugar fanatics and they believe their lives will end if they don't get it down...pronto!

While, everyone, here with T2D who treats \"blood sugar\" are getting worse (if you're forced to increase your diabetes drug dosage, what more evidence do you need to confirm this?). Why? Because treating a symptom (high blood sugar) only makes your diabetes worse. The only way to properly treat T2D is by decreasing or \"reversing\" your body's insulin resistance.  How do you do that? 1. Eat more fiber. 2. Drink more water 3. Intermittent fasting 4. Don't eat processed foods 5. Reduced red meat 6. Eat pickled foods & probiotics 7. Vinegar 8. Exercise 9. Rest 10. Live consistently   If you eat, properly, weight loss, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol...all of them...will resolve itself over time. Your father has proved this to be true. He has reversed his insulin resistance. He doesn't need meds to reduce his \"numbers\". That's the proof!  Is he still insulin resistant? Yes  What must he do to reverse his neuropathy? He must continue to hammer away at his insulin resistance.  How long will this take? Who knows? Who cares? Just follow his \"symptom\" (ex. A1C). If it continues to lower, his neuropathy will improve. You can't force a body to heal, itself.  PS: I'm 61 and I required a left hip replacement 12 years ago. The pain was excruciating. For the last 10 years, I walked a minimum of 13,000 steps a day (6 miles).... Oh, btw, NO SURGERY!  My mother has arthritis in her hands. I, too, am treating it through nutrition.

This process of \"reconstructing\" my body, restoring my health to peak \"efficiency\" has taken over a decade. This is in keeping with my original premiss: That diabetes is about uncontrolled internal inflammation due to poor lifestyle decisions, inefficiencies brought about by advancing hormonal changes and normal aging.  In other words, as we get old, your body begins to suck...at everything! Especially, repairing damaged tissues though daily wear and tear. And, as that unrepaired damage accumulates, chronic, unrelenting inflammation begins to set in...the stage is now set for \"auto-immune\" conditions...diseases caused by your body's immune system attacking, itself, ie. the \"good guys\". (IBS, rheumatoid arthritis, chrohn's and colitis, diabetes, etc..)  If I were to ask you, Hey, Ann, how would you go about the process of \"rebuilding\" your entire body? What would you do? What would you eat? How important does rest and recovery become? This is exactly what two aging athletes have adopted with incredible results: Tom Brady and Roger (\"The Maestro\") Federer...Their performance is not reflective of \"normal\" aging athletes.

{"threadId": "Fasting Blood Sugar", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                May I make some suggestions? I have been pre-diabetic for many years. Last July after vacation my A1c was over 7%. My doctor was going to put me on meds but I convinced her to let me try diet and exercise. Since then I have lost 20lbs and my blood work is coming back so normal that she took me off my cholesterol medicine. I still take blood pressure meds. My A1c is about the same as yours but my daily fasting has dropped. It ranges any where from 88 to 115. Your doctor may not be concerned because of the A1c but daily highs of over 140 is not good. Type 2 diabetics get into health risks when their sugar is continuously high. So, 30 minutes of brisk walking every day 5 to 6 days a week will help not only your sugar but your blood pressure and cholesterol. You can do that outside or there are numerous walk videos to do at home. Check out websites like WebMD, the Mayo Clinic and of course The American Diabetes Association. You must be proactive when it comes to your health. Some other suggestions I can make is measuring your food for portion control and writing the info in a notebook. People just do not realize how much that helps keep you on track. I count carbohydrates because that works for me. I use measuring cups and spoons to keep my portions correct. Get rid of the cookies, cakes, pies and white bread. Those types of foods will raise your sugar almost immediately. Have them only on special occasions. Another suggestion is to test your sugar 2 hours after you take your first bite of food. 1 hour is too soon. I also read a book that I purchased at Walmart which is really helpful. It is called \"60 ways to lower your Blood Sugar\" by Dennis Pollock. I did not purchase it right away because it sounded like one of those \"get rich quick ideas\" but I was totally wrong about it. It will give you ideas on how to cut your carbs, how to eat out and recipes for making snacks and food at home. You don't have to cut out your favorite foods just have less. At first you will get hungry between meals but eventually your body does adjust. If you have a snack try to make it healthy. Apple with string cheese, or a handful of nuts, etc. I do hope I was able to help out a little. Good Luck.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

Plus, you're so much kinder and gentler than me. Yippee kay-yay!  If overweight, weight loss is crucial in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes.  Everybody knows that...  Weight loss is 80% food. &, of that 80%, 50% is sugar. And where does the sugar come from? Processed food. Sugar and salt inundates processed food. This is why losing weight is next to impossible in this country. Because, (1.) Salty and sweet is so addictive, and (2.) If you remove process foods from the diet, you have to either... A. Eat raw, whole foods B. Cook the majority of your meals C. Stop eating at restaurants (at least the most affordable ones)  Ask a 20 or 30 something, \"What are the chances of you quitting all \"processed food\"? Zippo. No chance.  This generation and the one after that has no chance, imo. They will have Type 2 Diabetes up the ying yang. And, it's all because my generation, the Baby Boomers, decided it was OK to ignore their momma's golden rule... \"Eat your fruits and vegetables (or you can't leave the table)\".  PS: Exercise is critical for good health but it has little to do with weight loss, imo. Exercise makes your thirsty and water is crucial for weight loss and Type 2 Diabetes! Exercise helps us sleep and sleep is crucial for weight loss and Type 2 Diabetes. Exercise helps us stay young by building muscles and balancing hormone levels...and, that my friends, is a huge key to maintaining our health.

I eat lots of fruit because I can eat it raw and it's incredibly fibrous. As I've expanded my knowledge on T2 Diabetes, I believe, much of what's discussed on boards like this is simply the result of information \"manipulation\". For example, you don't eat fruit because it has too much sugar.  The primary differences between fruit and processed \"carbs\". Water...Fiber...Sugar Concentration  Finally, I will share an excerpt about Dr. Elliot P. Joslin, the father of Modern Diabetes Medicine (1869-1962)...  \"...Three horses draw the diabetic chariot and their names are \"diet, exercise and insulin\". In fact, all of us in our life\u2019s journey depend on the three, but seldom recognize the third although we often realize we are poor charioteers. Yet we fortunate ones have instinct to help us hold the reins, but the diabetic cannot trust his instincts as a guide, and in place of it must depend upon dieticians, nurses and doctors unless he understands his disease...\"    \"...UNLESS HE UNDERSTANDS HIS DISEASE.\" Bingo!  Life is so much different in 1869, 1962 and today. The only reason why people think I'm \"mean\" or \"hateful\"? It's because they think they know their disease. But, haven't spent the time to study themselves.  If you want to catch a mafia boss, all you have to do is follow the money. If you want to take true control of your Type 2 Diabetes, all you have to do is follow your \"symptoms\". High blood sugar is a \"symptom\", so, OK...sure...follow it to learn which way your diabetes is \"headed\".  But, people have been measuring \"blood glucose levels\" for over a hundred years, now.  And, it's believed that 1 in 3 adults, today, are either prediabetic or diabetic.  So, tell me. What has \"manipulating\" your blood glucose levels gotten \"you\"? Are the vast majority getting better? Or, worse?  Finally, Judy, common sense told you that weight loss restores normal blood sugar regulation, time and time, again. Joslin saw this through his studies on intermittent fasting. Today, we see this through gastric bypass surgery. wth, do you think is happening and why does it work in T2 D?  I'll tell you why!

Dear Dr. Nazario,  Why are so many diabetes specialists, physicians, and clinical researchers claiming that the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes, for the last 50 years, was not only \"ineffective\", but, in fact, the majority of the diabetes medications prescribed to patients, today, actually makes the disease \"progress\" and cause the patient to become MORE insulin resistant (and gain weight!)?  A growing sentiment among diabetes specialists and endocrinologists suggests the proper treatment for Type 2 Diabetes is expose the patient to LESS insulin, not more. Insulin, aka, the \"fat storage hormone\", so, the use of diabetes medications that either directly or indirectly increase the patient's insulin production (or, direct insulin injections) makes it difficult for a patient to lose fat. It is hypothesized that excessive fat surrounding vital organs (pancreas, heart and liver) may be the cause of elevated blood glucose levels characteristic of Type 2 Diabetes.  If ongoing research confirms that less insulin is the right \"treatment\" of T2D, then, is it possible that physicians (and pharmaceutical companies) that continue to prescribe drugs that raise insulin levels could be accused of medical malpractice?

And, the people that choose to understand what their body \"says\", are usually the ones that find peace and good health, naturally.  With that said, everybody gets the occasional cramp, now and then. For me, I'll get hammered with a monster hamstring cramp maybe once or twice a month (from sitting too long). If the frequency or severity of cramps were to increase, that's a clear signal, something has \"changed\"; I need to investigate and address. Proper hydration and adequate rest are the first two areas I revisit. They are critical for proper function of every part of the human body and for the vast majority of people with T2D, the two areas that they never think to \"improve\". Not only can you improve them, they are at the core of most every health problem in the modern world, today.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

{"threadId": "Nursing home caused the death of my mother after only 4 days", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Very sorry for your loss. The very same thing happened to me, only, it was my aunt, instead. The first (and last mistake) I made when I left my aunt at the hospital was, she was left in the caring hands of one of the finest hospitals in the country. They would take excellent care of her... She had T2 Diabetes, too. She was diagnosed nearly 20 years, prior, and was never admitted to a hospital her entire life. What could go wrong?..  ...She died inside a week.  Since then I've learned many things...about hospitals...and, about T2 Diabetes. Here's some examples... 1. Almost impossible to sleep on a hospital bed in I.C.U.; its ridiculous! 2. Lights remain on almost 24 hours in I.C.U. 3. Noise level, even at night, is maddening. 4. Hospitals have no freakin clue what T2 D's eat 5. Meds and antibiotics can cause blood sugar to soar. 6. Fear, anxiety and sleep deprivation does cause blood sugar to soar. 7. Hospitals \"deliberately\" err high on blood sugar than risk going too low. 8. When a patient suddenly becomes immobilized for long periods of time that can disrupt normal blood sugar control.  In other words, whatever worked for your mom, 20 years prior, flew out the window when she went into that nursing home. For example, my wife's grandmother (101) gained 20 lbs the first two months after admission (she weighed 100 lbs going in). I firmly believe, unless you've had T2 Diabetes for many years, yourself, you can't possibly grasp the impact your mother's move to a nursing home had on her body. It can be psychologically, emotionally and physically devastating. In addition, your mother had one of the most complex pre-existing conditions to \"manage\" when she was admitted. And, of course, everything they \"say\" about nursing homes, unfortunately, is true. Businesses that are highly regulated tend to be most concerned with \"compliance\" (to regulation). Keeping customers alive, unfortunately, is not part of the regs. Thus, unless you've had T2 Diabetes for many years, yourself, you can't possibly grasp the impact her move to a nursing home had on her body.  I said the exact same things about that hospital my aunt died in. Over the years, I've learned tons, more, about this disease and I've come to realize. I was wrong. I was talking out of my backside.  The lesson I learned, since, is... Prevent T2 Diabetes (or reverse it), cause if you elect to \"treat\" Type 2 Diabetes, you'll eventually wind up in the care of...places that are not great for your health. Embrace this invaluable lesson learned and don't let what happened to your mom (and my aunt) ever be forgotten.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

COMMIT TO MANAGING YOUR DIABETES. Make healthy eating and physical activity part of your daily routine. Take oral diabetes medications or insulin as directed. MONITOR YOUR BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL. You might need to check and record your blood sugar level at least three to four times a day \u2014 more often if you're ill or under stress. Careful monitoring is the only way to make sure your blood sugar level remains within your target range. ADJUST YOUR INSULIN DOSAGE AS NEEDED. Talk to your doctor or diabetes educator about how to adjust your insulin dosage in relation to your blood sugar level, what you eat, how active you are, whether you're ill and other factors. If your blood sugar level begins to rise, follow your diabetes treatment plan to return your blood sugar level to your target range. CHECK YOUR KETONE LEVEL. When you're ill or under stress, test your urine for excess ketones with an over-the-counter urine ketones test kit (e.g., \u201cKetostix\u201d). If your ketone level is moderate or high, contact your doctor right away BEFORE you need emergency care. If you have low levels of ketones, you may need to take more insulin. BE PREPARED TO ACT QUICKLY. If you suspect that you have diabetic ketoacidosis \u2014 your blood sugar level is high, and you have excess ketones in your urine \u2014 seek emergency care.\"  From the UK site: \u201cBrittle diabetes is often associated with gastroparesis (delayed stomach emptying) because it can affect the rate at which food, glucose and insulin is absorbed into the bloodstream. It is also frequently associated with psychological issues such as stress and depression.\u201d  The emotional factors in the equation are what makes me hesitant in responding to your post. I sense an urgent request for help or comments. But I also detect a sense of self-denial or reluctance to actively embrace the things that are so essential, so vital, to correcting the serious imbalances you have described. The reason your healthcare providers labelled your situation as \u201cdiabetes mismanagement\u201d is due to the fact your problems can usually be headed off at the pass BEFORE they reach a crisis stage.  I am NOT passing judgement or being overly critical. My only intent is to make you aware that you might have to just take several steps back and objectively evaluate what you\u2019re doing or perhaps, NOT doing (but should be).

There are still some folks here who have the equivalent of many decades of experience and our blood susgars are reasonably well controlled. Between us, we can provide you with plenty of suggestions that may enable you to join us in living virtually normal lives alongside this chronic disease.  Well, the ball is \"in your court.\" Only YOU can make the necessary decisions to learn all that you can in order to literally conquer/tame this disease. I have mentioned Dr. Richard K. Bernstein numerous times in my other posts. He is a type 1 diabetic who suffered severe diabetes-related complications and in his mid-30s, faced a very grim and uncertain future. He is credited with being the first person to adopt the concept of self-testing and self-monitoring of blood sugar levels as a tool to improving his roller-coaster blood sugars. Nearly fifty years later, he remains a thriving diabetic virtually free of all of the devastating complications he had when he was in his 30s. He recently celebrated his 83rd birthday last month. You can do this too (i.e., THRIVE, not just exist). However, only YOU can make the decisions and take the necessary steps to accomplish that goal.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

{"threadId": "How is A1C levels determined?", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    HbA1c (commonly abbreviated A1c) is a glucose-related chemical that is found in blood. By testing the percentage of A1c in someone\u2019s blood, doctors can tell how well a patient has tolerated and processed glucose over the past few months. The results are then compared to the percentages on an A1c chart. Changes in the A1c measurements over time can be used to determine how well the patient has managed his/her diabetes. It can also be used to gauge the progress of diabetes if a PWD's A1c continues to rise.  A finger-stick test is only a snapshot in time. In Dr. Bernstein's webcast this evening, he mentioned that some people can have near-normal tests virtually all of the time and still have A1c's in the 5.2 to 5.4 range. However, your A1c measurement of 7.2 suggests that you are spiking much higher than the \"normal\" range, especially if \"every morning I was under 120 most of the time.\" That begs the question: what was your blood sugar reading at bedtime?  If it was high but your pancreas was able to work overtime while you slept (to finally bring it down under 120 because you weren't eating), then that's just one factor in your 7.2 A1c. Your readings 2 hours post-meal, if high, would readily contribute to your 7.2 result because the A1c is an AVERAGE of all your glycated hemoglobin during periods when your blood sugar levels are both high and low. Your meter could be providing information based on whole blood glucose instead of the more contemporary plasma blood glucose.  And, or course, some meters are simply not very good. We call them RNG's which stand for \"random number generators.\" I won't mention brand names but users in the DOC (Diabetes Online Community) have often posted terrible and very inconsistent results with some meter brands; even when making multiple tests with different tests strips using the SAME DROP of blood. You might try asking your doctor for a new meter. The most accurate ones that I have tested are the Freestyle one with the Accu-Check brand coming in a close second. The newer Contour Next One meter also appears to be reasonably accurate. If your doctor doesn't have these brands on hand, visit the manufacturer's website. You can usually get a free coupon for the meter if your doctor will write a Rx for the strips. Of course, a more accurate meter may only shock you into realizing that your blood sugars have been running much higher than you thought. Particularly your test results AFTER meals and at BEDTIME.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

There are a couple of different complex formulas that will calculate an average blood glucose level to produce the percent of glycation.  It is very difficult to extrapolate an a1c from the bgs that you measure. Because the a1c gives you an average over the last 3 months (about the life expectancy of a haemoglobin molecule). So if you tested your bg every minute of every day for 3 months, you would have a good idea of what your a1c % will be. With a few tests per day, you'll never know exactly.

Be careful about blood sugar spikes after meals since over time this can cause a lot of organ damage (eyes, neuropathy (feet) etc). Try to get sugal levels below 160 but preferably below 140. Try eating smaller quantities of food and incorporate a good diet, exercise (preferably after meals to lower blood sugar spikes). Eat nuts such as almonds, mixed nuts (make sure they do not have too many calories or sugar). Fasting blood sugar levels should be close to 100 or preferably below 100 (Try not eating too much for dinner). Healthy Diet and Exercise is one of major keys to managing diabetes in my opinion.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

{"threadId": "How is A1C levels determined?", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                Hmm\u2026 Brunosbud. It seems like you\u2019ve changed somewhat since the original forum days. You seem to be too focused solely on self-awareness and lifestyle changes to battle (or \u201cfight\u201d) the insidious nature of the family of diseases that we call diabetes. I don\u2019t mean to be critical of you personally but do think that there is a need for balance. These message boards do not seem to draw a large enough audience to see a sufficient number of divergent posts and opinions so I\u2019ll weigh in with mine.  The reason why most people with diabetes (PWDs) and healthcare providers are \u201cso fixated on blood sugar...blood sugar readings...a1c...yada, yada, yada\u201d is because elevated blood sugars cause a great deal of damage to the human body. Most of us already know that high blood sugars damage (glycosylate) the proteins of virtually every cell that it comes into contact with. That\u2019s how and why PWDs get \u201ccomplications\u201d such as neuropathy (nerve damage), retinopathy (retinal or eye damage), nephropathy (kidney damage), atherosclerosis (blood vessel and heart damage), and a whole lot more. That even includes brain cells so it would be factual to state that the longer you let high blood sugars run amok, the dumber you\u2019re going to get (pun intended).  Jenny Ruhl, the author of the BloodSugar101 book and proprietor of the website with the same name, provided an excellent summary of why lowering blood sugars must be priority one. Her article, entitled \u201cResearch Connecting Organ Damage With Blood Sugar Level\u201d, doesn\u2019t leave much room for doubt because she includes full references to all of the studies and reports that support her statements. So, yes, it definitely needs to be \u201cfixated\u201d on:  http://www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/14045678.php  That does not mean that lifestyle changes should not be implemented concurrently with whatever measures are needed to lower blood glucose (BG) levels. However, to stop the damage, one does have to focus or fixate on getting their sugars down. Why? Because as beneficial as lifestyle changes are (weight loss, eating real food instead of toxic \u201cfood products\u201d, exercise/activity, etc.), all of them TAKE TIME to exert their beneficial effects. You can\u2019t lose weight overnight and switching to a healthier diet and ramping up your activity levels will not provide quick results \u2026 it takes time. But if your body is already undergoing gradual and relentless damage, it is essential to stop the damage and to stop it now!  That\u2019s why the Joselyn Diabetes Clinic now advocates starting Type 2 diabetics on insulin as soon as possible after diagnosis. Why? To bring down BG levels and STOP THE DAMAGE! Now! ASAP! At the same time, their diabetes specialists DO start to implement all of the things that you (me too) favor such as improvement or overhauls in eating habits (I dislike the term, diet), significant changes in overall lifestyle, incorporating customized plans of exercise/activity, healthy weight loss, etc. etc. Then, as benefits from all of the supporting lifestyle modifications take effect, the patients are gradually weaned off the insulin (unless, of course, they turn out to be insulin deficient). Some patients, after achieving significant weight loss, can become medication free; others may be switched from insulin to oral meds. To reinforce this critical point about stopping organ damage, reviewing Jenny Ruhl\u2019s article a second time might be useful.  Just FYI, I just passed my 76th birthday last month. At that age, I am still virtually medication free except for insulin and an asthma (steroid-free) rescue inhaler. I am not and have never been a burden to the healthcare system because the cost of my insurance premiums over the years greatly exceeds what nominal amounts that I draw from it. In other words, I pay more money INTO the system than the cost of medical services that I draw from it and surprise, surprise, that even includes my Medicare premiums. Medicare costs me more money than the nominal benefits that I draw from it. I even pay for my own annual comprehensive blood test panel and only see my endocrinologist twice a year (to renew my insulin and BG test strips Rx\u2019s). I haven\u2019t had a cold or a flu in over forty years and the only flu shot that I ever had was in 1999 when my Mom\u2019s visiting nurse stopped by to give her a shot and insisted that I get one also.  I generally refuse to eat processed foods which I do not consider to be \u201cfood\u201d at all but \u201cfood products\u201d. I scratch-cook most of my own meals, shop the produce section most frequently, do include some animal products such as seafood (wild caught only), poultry, lamb, eggs and a variety of cheeses. I avoid processed vegetable oils and rely almost exclusively on unprocessed coconut oil, avocado oil, and extra virgin olive oil. I do not eat GMOs or grains but do still consume waffles and pancakes that I make myself using a blend of coconut flour, oat bran, almond flour with lots of eggs. I went to the pharmacy yesterday to pick up my BG strips and finally consented to getting a pneumonia vaccine; the pharmacist couldn\u2019t believe that I was as old as my calendar age. That should give you an idea that when it comes to caring for one\u2019s own health, we are both on the same page. Where we differ is that I do not feel that healthy lifestyle alone (to improve diabetes) is something that can be applied to everyone as you seem so focused on doing. Age, gender, genetics, infirmities, other health issues, can all interfere. Perhaps you might find it beneficial to give your soap box a rest. You might win over more readers with a softer (and less frequent) approach.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},
{"threadId": "News: Diabetes Drug Gets FDA Warning", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    \u201c...All medications come with benefits and risks, and every decision for type 2 diabetes should be based on the patient-specific advantages and disadvantages of the different options available. ...\u201d said Jennifer Trujillo, PharmD, BCPS, CDE, Associate Professor of Clinical Pharmacy at University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.\u2029  \"...The FDA gathers new drug safety information from a number of sources, including the voluntary Adverse Event Reporting System and ongoing clinical trials. Drug safety communications address new and emerging postmarket drug safety issues or adverse events...\"\u2029  \"...These could include potentially \"SERIOUS or LIFE THREATENING RISKS\" or adverse events discovered after a drug is on the market; an issue affecting a large number of patients due to widespread use of a drug; new, clinically relevant information about a known adverse event; a new contraindication; previously unknown interactions; or a medication error that may result in a serious or life-threatening adverse reaction...\"    So, what does this all mean for the patient with Type 2 Diabetes?  1. If you are not aware or properly informed of the potential side-effects of any drug prescribed by your doctor, then, have your pharmacist explain it to you like you were a \"five year old\" or a \"golden retriever\". 2. Diabetes medications are powerful, potentially life threatening drugs. If you aren't sure about every detail of the prescription (frequency, amount, timing with meals/sleep, etc), you need to become \"clear\", asap. 3. You should keep a daily record of drug use, blood sugar readings & \"notes\" (ie. side-effects, possible cause for high or low readings, etc).  Lastly, if you've read any of the, above, you, now, know, just because your doctor prescribes a drug, doesn't make it safe. These FDA warnings take months, years, even, to accumulate sufficient evidence to issue public warnings, a demand for label change, or, have the drug removed from the shelves, entirely. Diabetes drugs have been notorious for FDA sanctions in the past. In fact, drug companies are shying away from diabetes meds because of the threat of monster class action lawsuits (\"death\" is not a cool side effect).  I don't take drugs, period. But, if I did, I'd ask my doctor not to prescribe drugs that have not been on the market for at least 3-5 years (or more!). The point is, I don't want to be nobody's \"guinea pig\", especially so, with the track record diabetes drugs have had with the FDA. Do you?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

Truth is, I only eat out when I have no choice.  With restaurants, it's all about taste. With Type 2 Diabetes, it's all about healthy. But, once you go healthy, you soon realize, healthy tastes best, hands down.  Why do you suppose every 5 star Michelin restaurant serves only dishes made from scratch? Have you ever seen a Top Chef open a can or box when preparing $100, $200, $500 meals? 95% of all restaurants use processed foods because food is perishable and throwing away food is equivalent to throwing away money. This is a huge reason why 1 in 4 adults in the US has either prediabetes or Type 2 Diabetes; 2 out of 3 adults in the US are either overweight or obese.  The sad irony is, all people care about is \"taste\". But, because they don't cook from scratch (or, are simply just too, ahem, \"busy\"), they wouldn't know great taste if it sat on their face. Eating restaurant food is a horrible form of self medication. It will NEVER end \"well\". The corner restaurant explosion from the 70s, on, is one of the biggest contributors to what you see, today.

Should I take diabetes drugs that effectively increase the amount of insulin in my bloodstream, or... B. Should I do everything I can (low carb, NO SUGAR!!!!!!!!, daily exercise, lower stress, increase sleep, no alcohol, no smoking) to reduce insulin in my bloodstream?  I chose \"B\".

Hopefully, by the end of this discussion, you'll refrain from asking \"what should I eat\" questions, forever.  First, please read the following, \"Diabetes and Inflammation\"  http://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-2-diabetes-guide/inflammation-and-diabetes#1 (I care not whether you believe what I say but once you read it, you will realize, I'm not pulling this stuff out of my *** and making it up as I go...)  So, now that you know there is a relationship between high blood sugar and the body's inflammatory response (agro immune system>>white blood cells sent>>release of \"cytokines\">>> yada, yada, yada...), there you go! Chemicals released from bloody fat cells causes inflammation>>>>blood sugar soars. Who knew?!?! So, brown rice causes inflammation (indirectly)! Hot-diggety-dog! Problem solved! I'm a genius!...  But, hold on...Not so fast.  There are many \"things\" that can illicit an inflammatory response besides pancakes, french fries, spaghetti, snickerdoodles and BROWN RICE (no matter how much you EAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!).  Again, INFLAMMATION: occurs when chemicals from the body's white blood cells are released into the blood or affected tissues. It's designed to \"protect your body\" from \"foreign substances\" (ie. crap released from fat cells). These chemicals (cytokines) increase the blood flow to the area of injury or infection, and may result in redness and warmth. So, in other words, it's not a good idea to have a bunch of fat cells because it can cause \"inflammation\" and, as a result, raise my blood sugar. BOO-HOO.  OK, so being fat is not good. So, I'll lose some weight. That's why my doctor keeps badgering me. Now, it makes sense...  Just one problem: To reiterate, there are many things (hundreds!!!!!!!!) that can/may cause short term or chronic inflammation. Here's a 1 minute sampling...  bee stings yelling at your spouse or child (You spouse yelling at you, You yelling at the driver in front of you, You flipping the driver as you drive by,...) bruising your shin on the coffee table medications your doctor prescribed to you (birth control, decongestants, vitamin B, steroids, barbiturates, etc, etc, etc) any drug you heard from a friend of a friend that lost 30 lbs in 30 days! arthritis IBS High cholesterol High blood pressure auto-immune diseases menstrual cramps tooth aches colds and flus pollen peanut butter household cleaning products cosmetics ridiculous, untested \"supplements\" you saw on Dr. _z or Dr. Ph_l or Dr. Who tooth aches menopause poison oak flu shots antibiotics blood pressure meds cholesterol meds and, of course, \"brown rice\"  So, how in the world, would anybody (& their grandmother) know the cause of YOUR \"inflammation\" that resulted in your A1C going up? Sure, it could be all that brown sugar you ate. But, it could also be 10,000 other things!!!!! And, because you \"shared\" so much detailed medical information about yourself and family history, we have all the data needed to reach a definite, lock down, air tight conclusion...Yup. Has to be the \"brown rice\"!    I don't mean to make light of your question...  The truth is: Each individual has a unique, one-of-a-kind, metabolic make-up and what is likely the cause of their uncontrolled blood sugar regulation is not one factor (brown rice) but the combination & strength of HUNDREDS of FACTORS (age, diet, weight, race, family history, environmental conditions, stress, co-morbidities, medications, social network, etc, etc). But, because you don't understand how complex Type 2 Diabetes is (much less how inflammation affects blood sugar) the only thing you \"fear\" is food...  ...like, brown rice.

Let me ask you, do you think you should be taking blood pressure meds at age 70 if you show B.P. readings in the 130's , low 140's? I bet you do...even, though, that would be \"normal\" B.P. for a 70 year old.  My father was on insulin and he was told that keeping his blood sugar levels slightly high (120's) was \"OK\" because, even back in the day, most physicians were fearful of raising insulin dosage too quickly. They knew, insulin injections were the last \"line of defense\" (for T2D) & once the effectiveness of insulin began to wane, you were up the proverbial \"creek\" without a paddle.  imo, direct injections of insulin, though it reduces high blood pressure, it \"fuels\" insulin resistance. In other words, it places your boat upstream from the falls. Instead of increasing the dose of insulin, I'd start paddling. Treat insulin with extreme caution and try to use the least amount by eating, right, and getting plenty of rest and exercise.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},
{"threadId": "Should I be concerned?", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    My answer is \"Yes\" and \"No\". As you intimated, your doctor is very busy and will most likely will contact you, soon, as both your fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1C indicate possible Type 2 Diabetes. You may not be pleased with the delay in their response but, imo, it's estimated that over 40 million adults in the US may have prediabetes or Type 2 Diabetes. In other words, take a number, have a seat; It's epidemic.  Should you be concerned? \"YES\"...If you're one to ignore your physician's instructions and don't make adjustments in diet and lead a more active lifestyle and allow your \"condition\" to worsen to the point that serious health conditions like retinopathy, neuropathy or permanent kidney damage develope, sure, be concerned.  But, people that \"research\" their health and study ways to prevent their disease from getting worse, you never read or hear about them because they choose to take responsibility for their health. They believe, since nobody (but them) has any \"skin\" in their survival, it's in their best interests to learn as much as possible about Type 2 Diabetes, regardless whether they have it or not...for their family's sake.  If you're such a person, then, \"NO\". I wouldn't be too concerned. The bottomline: Type 2 Diabetes is reversible. In other words, you can bring those numbers (161 & 6.7) to safe numbers (less than 100 and 6.0) through diet, exercise, etc, all, without meds. At least, that's what I've done.  So, should you be concerned? I dunno. It depends what you believe. Anyone else's opinion is entirely irrelevant.  PS: If you have weight to lose, start, now. If you can do that (5-10%), your \"numbers\" will improve, guaranteed. You need a doctor to do that?<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

Do you still take your blood glucose readings on a daily basis and have your doctor order an HBA1C and review the results with you?  Diabetes can definitely be reversed with a concentrated effort. It is possible that your blood glucose readings were elevated by your illness but went back down once your illness was treated and resolved. This is usually very rare as most of us need to work hard with lifestyle changes to control and/or reverse TD2. Again, you are very fortunate.

There is a doctor that replies occasionally to posts - Brunilda Nazario, MD. Click on the link to her bio at the top right-hand side of the screen.  Even the doctor can not give you medical advice or diagnose here. Scroll to the bottom of the screen to read the disclaimers that cover all WebMD message boards. We can offer advice based on our own experiences, though.  A regular member of this message board, brunosbud, is very knowledgeable and offers excellent advice. He has reversed his own diabetes, as many of us her have, by eating a healthy diet and getting as much activity as possible. You are right - all carbohydrates do convert to glucose and is stored as fat in our bodies. You do not need a doctor to help you reverse your diabetes. Start now by changing your lifestyle. If you smoke, quit. If you drink too much alcohol, stop. Get more exercise. Eat the right foods - lean proteins, lean dairy, vegetables and a small amount of a whole grain carbohydrate. You will need to experiment to see what types of carbohydrates to limit and which ones to eliminate. Personally, any type of rice will cause my blood glucose reading to rise, while white potatoes in small quantities are fine for me. Do not eat processed foods, especially those containing high fructose corn syrup. Never drink fruit juice, eat the whole fruit since they contain more fiber.  You may want to see a certified diabetes educator, a dietician or a nutritionist for help in understanding how to eat a health diet. Do not be scared, be proactive and make the needed lifestyle changes that will improve and could even save your life. Yes, it takes work but the results are far worth the effort.  I pray you find answers and relief soon.  Blessings, -Dave<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

{"threadId": "Diabetes", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Think of having Type 2 Diabetes like having a fever. If your child (or mom) had a fever of 102, would you be \"concerned\"?  Maybe...but, I'd be more \"concerned\" if her temperature, the next day, was 103. In other words, every parent knows, a single reading is useless. It's the \"trend\" (of several readings) that matters.  but, the trend of Type 2 Diabetes is entirely dependent on one person and one person, alone. Every person is dependent on making common sense decisions in the best interests of their own safety. Doctors have little control over what a person's sugar \"trend\" will follow because they don't fill your mom's fork. They don't tie your mom's exercise tennies. They don't fill your mom's cup with water (instead of beer or juice). &, they surely have no control over what cockamamie advice your mom follows (especially, when the \"trend: is going up).  At the end of the day, \"concern\" is a useless state of mind. All that matters is how each person feels about their life and whether they're willing to make smart lifestyle adjustments so they can be on this earth as long as they can.   More accurately, I'd be more concerned if my doctor was increasing the drug \"dosage\" to my mom than a blood sugar reading. A blood sugar reading is no different than a temperature reading. Every parent in Africa (with half a brain) knows, it's not the \"temperature\" that's causes the ebola fever to rage, that threatens their child's life. It's the ebola \"virus\" that's the root cause. Temperature is only a means to measure how badly the fire is raging, within.  So, why are all Type 2 Diabetics \"concerned\" about a blood sugar measure?  Because, they believe \"blood sugar\" is what causes Type 2 Diabetes. The only thing that most diabetes drugs do is \"artificially\" lower blood sugar, which is no different than placing a ebola patient in an ice bath. It's a quick fix. It doesn't address root cause (the virus). It's a \"temporary\" measure to keep the patient alive until they can get a hold of the ebola vaccine.  So, again, why are all Type 2 Diabetics \"concerned\" about a measure?  Because, they don't know a thing about Type 2 Diabetes...<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

{"threadId": "diabetes", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Question: Can you have insulin resistance yet still show normal blood sugars? I'll answer it for you...  Yes ( http://www.pre-diabetes.com/prediabetes/normal-blood-sugar-can-be-insulin-resistant.html) and, oh, btw. Here's a list of a few diseases linked to \"insulin resistance\"...  Obesity High Blood Pressure High Cholesterol Heart Disease Cancer  You don't give any details so I can't/won't comment on your particular situation...no age, no family history, no comorbidities, weight, smoking, alcohol, diet, etc...You do say, you ignored the changes recommended to you by your doctors...that says much, but, here's the bottomline.  You're either genius or you don't know a thing about Type 2 Diabetes. Either way, just because a person doesn't shows no signs of high blood sugar, don't mean jack. You can be diagnosed with prediabetes (metabolic syndrome) and still pass fasting blood glucose test, so without any specific \"details\", no body in the world can argue your claims of cure, but at the same time, no one can congratulate you, either. Since, your doctor(s) have all that information, the only opinion that matters, really, is their's.   Regardless, I have successfully \"reversed\" my initial prediabetes diagnosis. That was 10 years, ago. Here's a list of what insulin resistance (and alcoholism) did to my body (besides high blood sugars): 1. High Blood Pressure 2. High Triglycerides 3. Allergies 4. Sleep Apnea 5. Insomnia 6. Wheezing night coughing 7. Acne 8. Impaired night vision 9. Lost half my teeth 10.Lost half my hair 11.Almost lost my wife (and, my dogs) 12.Frequent, colds, headaches, flu 13.Gastric Reflux 14.Muscle cramps 15.Bad breath and body odor 16.Dandruff 17.Road Rage  I am 61, male, family of 4, semi-retired, bad golfer, plant based, fresh, whole food diet, walk 6 miles, min, everyday, take no meds, suffer zero medical issues. and, I wear dentures...  What I learned about Type 2 Diabetes over these last 10 years? 1. It is reversible (\"curable\") 2. Diabetes is, without question, a medical condition that affects people differently, and 3. Type 2 Diabetes is not the problem that people face on this board. Chronic inflammation resulting in the development and progression of \"insulin resistance\" is the real deal. Everybody in this country has developing insulin resistance (including myself) therefore everyone is on the T2D \"spectrum\". EVERYONE! Finally, insulin resistance can only be reversed through reduced inflammatory lifestyle changes (&, you don't get pregnant by \"accident\", either...).  When you metabolically rehabilitate your body through reducing insulin resistance, you can't possibly imagine just how fkdup your body was, before the journey. The work you put in, you get it all back. And, more. The transformation and rejuvenation your body undergoes is a transcendent experience, imo. Normal blood sugar control is just the tip of the iceberg. Not only, has all the, above, \"symptoms\" disappeared, not only have I thrown away all my old glucometers, I don't need/wear my driving glasses, anymore.

{"threadId": "Second opinion on blood test results", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    5.3% is a great A1C! Your LDL and total cholesterol are also in the \"desirable\" range. However, your doctor should be basing his recommendation on your overall risk factors. It's important to advocate for yourself and ask your doctor what he is basing his recommendation on. If you feel unsure, you have every right to seek out a second opinion.  One note, if you do end up taking a statin, you should ask your doctor about supplementing with CoQ10. Statins can lower your CoQ10 levels which can be an issue since CoQ10 helps us produce cellular energy and protects our cells from oxidative damage.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},
{"threadId": "Type 2 diabetes and methadone withdrawal", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Jada, what type of insulin do you use? Many times it takes adjustments in dosaging over a period of time. Along with using insulin, of course, you still need to watch your intake of food carefully, keeping in balance your proteins, carbs and fats.  I use two insulins to keep my blood sugar in control. ALSO, diet and physical activity along with insulin injections help even further with blood sugar control. Doing all three can bring your blood glucose numbers toward normal.  I use a 24-hour acting insulin along with a rapid-acting insulin for meals. My body has a very low tolerance for carbohydrates. My insulin dosages were constantly adjusted in the beginning. Doctors tend to be on the conservative side when dealing with insulin. I had a very high A1C when diagnosed at 13.2. I managed to get it down to 5.6 with the proper dosage of insulin, diet and exercise/physical activity. It's important to remember that ALL three of these things are important in bringing your blood glucose under control.  If you can, talk with a doctor regarding your insulin dosaging. I don't know where you live, but applying for state aid for health benefits might be able to help you out.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

{"threadId": "Metphormin", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Hello.  The only problem you will experience by not taking your metformin is that your blood glucose readings may continue to rise. Be aware that metformin is not designed to lower your blood glucose readings, but decrease your insulin resistance so your body can use the insulin it is still producing. You will have no withdrawal symptoms if that what you are worried about. Simply have your script refilled and resume your metformin at the prescribed dose.  You may want to put your metformin on auto-refill (if available) with your pharmacy so this does not happen again.  Blessings, -Dave<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},

Have you seen an endocrinologist (diabetes specialist) for a second opinion other than your primary doctor? Are your blood glucose levels (both testing at home and HBA1C) readings in control? Are you eating a healthy diet and getting as much exercise as possible?  While I am not a doctor, I know that you can sometimes alleviate the symptoms of neuropathy by making sure your blood glucose readings are in control. This is done primarily with a healthy diet and activity, plus medication if needed. As far as a prognosis, I can not offer that but if your primary doctor can not or will not, then it is time for that second opinion.  I pray you find answers and relief soon.

{"threadId": "Gangrene In Diabetes", "replyText": "<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    If you develop gangrene, you should seek immediate medical attention. Urgent care is needed to remove the dead tissue and prevent bacteria from spreading through your bloodstream. If left untreated, gangrene can lead to a life-threatening infection.  What's the link between gangrene & Diabetes?  In order for gangrene to occur, there's got to be a \"perfect storm\"... 1. Damage to nerve tissue. This is why gangrene happens most to fingers and toes. Diabetes causes neuropathy, typically, to lower extremities, fingers and toes. 2. High blood sugar damages blood vessels and limits blood circulation to injured/infected areas. Without blood flow, healing of injuries becomes slow and difficult. 3. High blood sugar weakens the immune system. Weak immune systems can be caused by: diabetes chemotherapy HIV malnutrition kidney failure being over the age of 60  This is why I explained a few weeks ago about surgery and diabetes. It's the same deal. Diabetes compromises \"normal recovery\", thereby, making any open wound a potential life threatening event. I hope this explains (for the umpteenth time) why proper treatment of Type 2 Diabetes through improvements in diet, exercise and other lifestyle adjustments is so critical. If you allow your diabetes to \"progress\", you will eventually live to regret that decision. Pay, now, or pay, later. There're no free rides.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"},
